maintenance worker there measuring the bathroom counter, so maybe they're doing work in some units .\\n38

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            There is virtually no counterspace in the bathroom at all .\\n42

bathroom but nothing worth complaining about .\\n43



                                                                                                                                                     The bathroom was very clean and well appointed with nice towels and toiletries, it was not big, but room enough to do what one needs to .\\n46                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The Tuscan Inn room was quite nicely appointed, the bed was comfortable the chairs   TV adequate, the bathroom reasonably good .\\n47                                                                                                                                       my only real complaint would be that the bathroom does not have a separate vanity area, so 2 people getting dressed had to improvise, which was kind of surprising since the bathrooms were all redone on 2005 .\\n48                                                                                                                     The clever use of mirrors behind the bed helped to create the illusion of space, however, in reality the room was cramped and with two of us trying to use the hand basin and bathroom at the same time was particularly awkward .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The bathroom containing the toilet and the shower was also very small, not to mention the sink and counter directly outside of it .\\n50   Turning the bathroom light on also turns the counter light on, meaning a middle, of, the, night trip to the bathroom means the whole side of the room gets illuminated  and the wooden shutters that were installed in place of traditional curtains to add to the hotel's theme do absolutely nothing to keep the room dark once the sun comes up .\\n51

without any privacy and there was a small bathroom for the toilet and bath shower .\\n54

clean and perfectly acceptable .\\n55

shower stall could have been bigger as the bathroom itself was pretty large .\\n58

had to be in the bedroom .\\n59

because it was pretty big with large bathroom ,  it was room 459 ,  and the room had all the amenities we were looking for .\\n61

  The room   and bathroom were perfect in size,  just what is needed .\\n62

different room .\\n63

                                                                                                                         Although the rooms were clean and fresh, one of ours had several small problems ,  the phone didn't work, the bathroom door handle was quite loose, and the thermostat didn't work properly .\\n65

linen daily, and the staff extremely helpful and friendly .\\n66

etc .\\n67                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   I really didn't get a chance to experience the staff's level of service but the rooms are small as is the bathroom .\\n68

also small  it was difficult to close the door once inside to avoid the door hitting you no joke !\\n69

preferred, but our sink was inside the bathroom .\\n70                                                                                                                                                                             The bathroom was clean and bright and the toiletries   were so good that we took the leftovers home because there was a website selling the shampoo listed on the bottle .\\n71                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           The rooms were very nice, could of use just a little more shelf space by the bathroom sink .\\n72                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The bathroom was clean but a little dated .\\n73

decor but it was clean and large enough .\\n74

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Hair dryer in bathroom constantly fell in sink from it's holder when anyone used the door to our room .\\n76

us to book 2 rooms, thus giving the 4 of us a bit more space and 2 bathrooms   .\\n77

         The manual transmission lets me control the car better and achieve higher mileage .\\n39                                                                                                                                                  So beware, if you are trading in your V8 for a mileage vehicle, this is not it in my case .\\n40

mileage, I mostly drive city and I am currently receiving 25 .\\n43                                                                                                                                                                                       I just love the VCM makes the car give great mileage .\\n44

                                                                                                                                        Don't buy this car if you want good gas mileage .\\n46                                                                                                  I have a V, 6 with Variable Cylinder Management which is supposed to let the car run on 3,4 or 6 cylinders, as needed, to improve mileage .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                                                             My BMW 530i got better mileage .\\n48                                                                                                   It is fun to drive, I love the color, it has great features, the sound system is nice, the power is perfect and the gas mileage is great !\\n49                                                                                                                                           Fun to drive, fairly roomy, looks good, gas mileage is OK  , but not as good as Honda advertises .\\n50                                                                                                                                                                     Gas mileage is wonderful, 1st tank 26 mpg with almost all city driving .\\n51                                                                                                                             I had tons of room in my 4Runner, but I needed something that would get better gas mileage w o giving up power .\\n52                                                                                                                                                                                             I am so very disappointed with the gas mileage !\\n53                                                                                                                                                                                        I traded for better mileage, and this is what I got .\\n54                                                                                                                                          I will warn you though, that if you drive it like it should be driven, gas mileage isn't the best .\\n55                                                                                                                                                     It feels safe, performs well, looks fantastic and gets decent gas mileage for its size .\\n56                                                                                                                                                                   The Accord is better than other those car on gas mileage and reliability .\\n57                                                                                                                                                                   Strangely, the gas mileage is not as good as the Acura but is acceptable .\\n58

                                                                                                  Gas mileage is horrible too, 20 mpg city highway after 6000 miles .\\n60                                                                                                                                       If you are looking for a car that is affordable and well built this is the car for you bad gas mileage\\n61                                                                                                                                        In reality we have been very disappointed our in city mileage is 16, 17 and highway is better at 27 .\\n62                                                                                                                         While the mileage is not bad it good be better, but as the acceleration is good for a 4 cylinder it's a trade, off .\\n63                                                                                                                                      I am sure as gas prices go up cars will be built to get better mileage at the expense of acceleration .\\n64                                                                                                                                     Good looking inside and out, comfortable and roomy, commendable performance, and excellent gas mileage .\\n65                                                                                                                                       I live in Chicago and drive downtown and back 2 times a week for school and am getting great mileage .\\n66                                                                                                                                                        Only update is after about 5k miles the fuel mileage is less than I had anticipated .\\n67                                                                                                               Everything else such gas mileage, handling, stereo system is fine but it doesn't make up for the loud rattles and wind noise .\\n68                                                                                                                         It's almost embarrassing driving such a nice car around a parking lot and have it sound like a high mileage beater .\\n69                                                                                                                             So I saved $2 K upfront and will also save down the road since the 4 cylinder gets slightly better gas mileage .\\n70                                                                                                                                                                         It is a well built car that runs smooth and gets great gas mileage .\\n71                                                                                                                                                                                                 Gas mileage is still getting better though .\\n72                                                                                                                                                                           The gas mileage on the highway is about the same for both models .\\n73                                                                                                                                        Local mileage with the '08 has been about 24 mpg, and about 25 mpg with the '06's that we've leased .\\n74                                                                                                                                                              I decided to go back to Honda as even with high mileage they keep their value .\\n75                                                                                                                          Mileage ,  also not impressive ,  all I can get is about 24mpg, far from the 32 mpg you see on the window sticker .\\n76                                                                                                                                                                           Posted mileage ratings are for those who have a heavy right foot .\\n77                                                                                                                                                            Gas mileage is fantastic especially going from a V8 SUV to a 4 cylinder sedan   .\\n78            I was tempted to go for the V6, but I drive 42 miles one way to work and we have an '07 Odyssey with the variable cylinder management system and unless you're on long highway runs it doesn't get the gas mileage Honda claims .\\n79                                                                       I just love this car ,  and with almost double the highway gas mileage that I was getting with my Grand Cherokee ,  that adds a lot of $$ towards my monthly payment .\\n80                                                                                                                                                                                                            190 hp and superior gas mileage .\\n81                                                                                                                                                                 It wasn't worth saving the little difference in gas mileage for this Honda .\\n82                                                                                                                   The gas mileage is about 45 to the gallon going on the highway with cruise at about 800 or 900 RPM and about 38 going 70 .\\n83                                                                                                                                                  The Gas mileage is good, the acceleration sometime is slow when cold from 1st to 2nd gear .\\n84                                                                                                                                                                                     I hope to get better mileage on extended highway trips .\\n85                                                                                                          I think the mileage would be even better with a 6, speed stick shift to drop the

maintenance worker there measuring the bathroom counter, so maybe they're doing work in some units .\\n38

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            There is virtually no counterspace in the bathroom at all .\\n42

bathroom but nothing worth complaining about .\\n43



nice towels and toiletries, it was not big, but room enough to do what one needs to .\\n46

adequate, the bathroom reasonably good .\\n47                                                                                                                                       my only real complaint would be that the bathroom does not have a separate vanity area, so 2 people getting dressed had to improvise, which was kind of surprising since the bathrooms were all redone on 2005 .\\n48                                                                                                                     The clever use of mirrors behind the bed helped to create the illusion of space, however, in reality the room was cramped and with two of us trying to use the hand basin and bathroom at the same time was particularly awkward .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The bathroom containing the toilet and the shower was also very small, not to mention the sink and counter directly outside of it .\\n50   Turning the bathroom light on also turns the counter light on, meaning a middle, of, the, night trip to the bathroom means the whole side of the room gets illuminated  and the wooden shutters that were installed in place of traditional curtains to add to the hotel's theme do absolutely nothing to keep the room dark once the sun comes up .\\n51

without any privacy and there was a small bathroom for the toilet and bath shower .\\n54

clean and perfectly acceptable .\\n55

had to be in the bedroom .\\n59

different room .\\n63

noise .\\n18

sacrificing fuel mileage .\\n23

                                                                                                                                     Gas mileage has been a bit disappointing, but it has been improving .\\n32                                                                                                                                        the variable cylinder management changes to 4 cyl when not under load, this helps with fuel mileage .\\n33                                                                                                                                               After owning a Honda Accord EX   I had to go back to the Honda the gas mileage can't be beat .\\n34

problems .\\n37                                                                                                                              Aside from missing the turbo's acceleration, I've preferred the Accord's better mileage, handling and comfort .\\n38                                                                                                                                                          The manual transmission lets me control the car better and achieve higher mileage .\\n39                                                                                                                                                  So beware, if you are trading in your V8 for a mileage vehicle, this is not it in my case .\\n40

mileage is 14 .\\n42                                                                                                                                                                Gets great gas

needed, to improve mileage .\\n47

                                                              I traded for better mileage, and this is what I got .\\n54                                                                                                                                          I will warn you though, that if you drive it like it should be driven, gas mileage isn't the best .\\n55

mileage\\n61                                                                                                                                        In reality we have been very disappointed our in city mileage is 16, 17 and highway is better at 27 .\\n62                                                                                                                         While the mileage is not bad it good be better, but as the acceleration is good for a 4 cylinder it's a trade, off .\\n63                                                                                                                                      I am sure as gas prices go up cars will be built to get better mileage at the expense of acceleration .\\n64

getting great mileage .\\n66                                                                                                                                                        Only update is after about 5k miles the fuel mileage is less than I had anticipated .\\n67                                                                                                               Everything else such gas mileage, handling, stereo system is fine but it doesn't make up for the loud rattles and wind noise .\\n68                                                                                                                         It's almost embarrassing driving such a nice car around a parking lot and have it sound like a high mileage beater .\\n69                                                                                                                             So I saved $2 K upfront and will also save down the road since the 4 cylinder gets slightly better gas mileage .\\n70                                                                                                                                                                         It is a well built car that runs smooth and gets great gas mileage .\\n71                                                                                                                                                                                                 Gas mileage is still getting better though .\\n72                                                                                                                                                                           The gas mileage on the highway is about the same for both models .\\n73                                                                                                                                        Local mileage with the '08 has been about 24 mpg, and about 25 mpg with the '06's that we've leased .\\n74                                                                                                                                                              I decided to go back to Honda as even with high mileage they keep their value .\\n75                                                                                                                          Mileage ,  also not impressive ,  all I can get is about 24mpg, far from the 32 mpg you see on the window sticker .\\n76                                                                                                                                                                           Posted mileage ratings are for those who have a heavy right foot .\\n77                                                                                                                                                            Gas mileage is fantastic especially going from a V8 SUV to a 4 cylinder sedan   .\\n78            I was tempted to go for the V6, but I drive 42 miles one way to work and we have an '07 Odyssey with the variable cylinder management system and unless you're on long highway runs it doesn't get the gas mileage Honda claims .\\n79                                                                       I just love this car ,  and with almost double the highway gas mileage that I was getting with my Grand Cherokee ,  that adds a lot of $$ towards my monthly payment .\\n80                                                                                                                                                                                                            190 hp and superior gas mileage .\\n81                                                                                                                                                                 It wasn't worth saving the little difference in gas mileage for this Honda .\\n82                                                                                                                   The gas mileage is about 45 to the gallon going on the highway with cruise at about 800 or 900 RPM and about 38 going 70 .\\n83                                                                                                                                                  The Gas mileage is good, the acceleration sometime is slow when cold from 1st to 2nd gear .\\n84                                                                                                                                                                                     I hope to get better mileage on extended highway trips .\\n85                                                                                                          I think the mileage would be even better with a 6, speed stick shift to drop the tachometer from ~2300 rpm to <2000 rpm at 60 mph .\\n86                                                                                                                                                                      Gas mileage has been improving and is now consistently 29 hwy 22 city .\\n87

is reliable .\\n90                                                                                                                       So far, the reliability has been as expected, it is comfortable

 I thought it would be fitting to christen my Kindle with the Stephen King novella UR, so went to the Amazon site on my computer and clicked on the button to buy it .\\n0                                                                                                                                                                                                            As soon as I'd clicked the

reading through the introductory guide that loads up automatically at the start and following along it took me almost no time to learn which buttons are where and what each of them do .\\n2                                                   I started reading with the default size without my glasses and noticed I was squinting a bit, so changed to one size larger with a couple button clicks and it was much easier without feeling like the print was too big and took up too much of the page .\\n3

.\\n4                                                                                                                                                  It took very little time to get used to having to push a button to turn pages and the screen flash as they turn only really startled me the first few times .\\n5                                                                                                                                 I don't feel the need to push the button ahead of time to prepare for the end of the page at all, which evidently a lot of Kindle 1 owners do since it's a bit more sluggish .\\n6                                                unintended page changes, the awkward way I sometimes have to hold it to keep from hitting buttons, the sometimes slow page refresh, and the screen freezes that now has me traveling with a paper clip lest I need to do a reset while commuting on the train .\\n7

to put the device to sleep .\\n8

interior of the button to get it to click .\\n10                                                                                                                                                                                                Combine that with the smaller button sizes and one major source of frustration has been instantly eliminated !\\n11                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The little power button at the top of the Kindle is really a power slide .\\n12                                                                                                                                                                                                 The change in the hinging and size of the buttons is major plus and would make it hard to go back to the K1 .\\n13                                                                                                                                                 sleeker look and feel  , sharper screen, no longer accidentally depressing the next page button by accident and having to find your place in the book again .\\n14                                                                                                                                                                           ,  The 5, way button, though a bit small, allows you to select left and right, and not just up and down like the original version .\\n15                                                                                                       Only issue is I need to recalibrate now, , in general, I try to anticipate how much time it will take the next page to load, and when I'm two lines from the bottom, I would hit the next page button .\\n16

.\\n19                                                                                                                                                                     I like to read holding the

major improvement .\\n21

sometimes pulled the battery door off .\\n23

pages don't change even if you grab by the buttons .\\n25                                                                                                                                              Yet changing pages is effortless when you do ,  the buttons are right between your thumbs and the slightest pressure on their faces is enough to activate them .\\n26                                                                                                          That it doesn't have the quirky, clunky, annoying buttons that filled \\u00be of each side of its predecessor, buttons that caused dozens upon dozens of accidental page turns makes it that much sexier .\\n27

                                                                                                                                                                                           It has the feel of the mouse button in the middle of a laptop keyboard and I never liked those .\\n29

                                                                                                                                 if you don't upgrade, you will regret it every time you accidentally hit one of the obscenely large buttons and advance or retreat one, two, three, or even four pages .\\n31

better .\\n32                                                                                                                                                                                                                   With the Kindle 1, I was constantly at risk of accidentally bumping the next page buttons .\\n33

lot less sensitive .\\n34

took a little getting used to after having used the Kindle 1, especially since the context menus that I was used to in the first gen have changed due to the new directional button, but for any Kindle user, this change is a god send .\\n36                                                                                                                                                                                  It looks good, feels good in the hand, has good buttons, which are easy to operate on purpose but not so easy accidentally .\\n37

up the dictionary, starting with that entry .\\n38                                                                                                                                                                                                                      It's very easy to page forward or backward through the text with the dedicated buttons .\\n39                                                                                                      The button layout looks odd because it's so regularly spaced in rows versus the keyboard's staggered style, but it isn't any harder to use than a cellphone's tri, letter entry or blackberry keyboard .\\n40

      Just like how I prefer to grasp the page a few sentences before the end of a page, I tend to press the  Next Page  button a bit sooner than I finish reading the page .\\n43                                                                                        The lag actually helps in that respect, and even so, the lag between pushing the button and the new page appearing is much faster than I could ever physically flip any book page without shearing it from the spine .\\n44

                                                                                                             When I'm trying to go to the next page, I hit the home button by accident a lot .\\n60                                                                                                                                                                                                                       I also hate the fact that you really have to push the buttons hard to change the page .\\n61                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 I really liked the extra responsiveness of the K1 buttons   .\\n62                                                                                                                                                                                                            However I was disappointed to discover that I was unable to press the buttons from that position .\\n63                                                                                                                                                                                             With the K2 I can turn on the TTS feature with one button, place it beside me, and have it read to me all night !\\n64                                                                                                                                                                                        I contemplated changes to my beloved Kindle with dread, I was one of the few who loved the old page, turning buttons .\\n65                                                                                                                                                                                                                    I worried that the new buttons would be Sony Reader size, and impossible for me to press .\\n66                                                                                                                                                                   Thankfully the buttons are still at least thumb, size, and may appear hard to press, until you realize that they are hinged on the inside .\\n67                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 I like the new size and feel of the buttons .\\n68                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  It is much harder now to accidentally hit the page buttons .\\n69                                                                                                                                                                                                                               But holding the darn thing was a chore without pressing that next button page .\\n70                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Kind of hard to do when you're inadvertently pressing buttons .\\n71                                                                                                                                                                                              Also the keyboard has been redesigned to make things easier as well as added buttons like  menu  which is nice .\\n72                                                                                                                                            I find myself using a large size typeface to compensate for the lack of contrast, but this means frequent  next page  button presses which is extremely annoying .\\n73                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The buttons have a cheap feel .\\n74

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Upgrade the quality of the hardware especially the buttons .\\n76

.\\n77                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The next, previous, back buttons are much smaller and are hard to hit accidentally .\\n78

convex tops .\\n79                                                                                                                                                                                                                     The on, off button is now on top and the radio on, off switch is now in a software menu .\\n80

           My thanks to  Arts&HistoryFan  for pointing out that when you hit the menu button, the time is shown in the top banner .\\n82                                                                                                       Yes, I noticed some of the initial design flaws in the first, generation Kindle ,  the placement of the  next page  buttons, the general sense of flimsiness ,  but I decided I could live with those .\\n83                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Opened the box, press the button and it begins downloading books that I pre, ordered .\\n84                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The welcome screen comes on to explain all the buttons .\\n85                                                                                                                                                                               One thing I didn't like was the page next button failed to work when the text to speech was in use and I wanted to skip ahead .\\n86                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             sym button depressed at same time\\n87                                                                                                                                                                 Buttons are accessible, raised for convenience of all involved ,  another big plus for the visually impaired or those with other conditions .\\n88                                                                                       The sound button is raised only slightly ,  fine for VI but potentially problematic for those with arthritis or other issues with fine motor function as it is a relatively thin button that must be pressed slightly .\\n89                                                                                                                                                                                        The buttons are well placed and need a good push to change pages, but not so much that it detracts from your reading .\\n90                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Navigation is much easier with the 5, way button .\\n91                                                                                                                                                               I miss having a dedicated button to deactivate the wireess, but the overall device has improved so much that I will get over the loss quickly .\\n92

use the feature .\\n96

                                                        My one complaint is that I'd like a  previous page  button on both side of the screen, the way there's a  next page  button on both sides, but that's a very minor consideration .\\n113                                                                                                                                             Reading the book

eyes for hours on end and the Kindle 2 display is as nice to read as any traditional book .\\n41                                                                                                        I won't be using the feature much anyway because I get a lot more out of a book I'm reading with my eyes and hearing the voice of the storyteller in my mind .\\n42                                                                                                                                                                                                                      It's easier on the eyes not to have that light .\\n43                                                                                                                                                                              It's also easy to make the font larger whenever necessary, like when my eyes are tired .\\n44

                                                   Not having your eyeballs scorched, seared and scarred by the traditional computer screen is really nice .\\n48                                                                                                                           With the great technology of electronic ink, there isn't any back, lighting pounding relentlessly like the desert sun on your tender eyes .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                                                This means you can read for longer periods of time without eyestrain .\\n50

                                                         The Kindle does not have a screen that taxes the eyes, and allows me to shift some of my time away from the computer for blogs that I would normally read online .\\n52                                                                                                                                                 It's lightweight and allows changes in font size that enables ease of reading no matter how tired your eyes may get .\\n53                                                                                                                                                     I do think the e, ink e, paper is a lot easier on my eyes for reading than the glossy or matte computer screens .\\n54                                                                                                                                                     The screen size is close enough to the size of a paperback book page that it hasn't caused my eyes any problems .\\n55

                                                      8 E, Ink display is easy to read and doesn't strain your eyes and reads better than a printed page .\\n57

tired too quickly .\\n64                                                                                                                                                           I finally got the

displayed .\\n2                                                                                                                                                                                           it's a curiousity for most of us, traffic and content updates   .\\n3   The text to speech is great for not having to look down at the screen endangering yourself and others on the road and after the voice updates the Garmin put out for the 255W the scratchiness and robotic sounding voice became crisp and very audible .\\n4

card to download map updates .\\n6                                                                                                                                         Another big name site did the same thing and told me that I would have to pay Garmin to update to the latest maps .\\n7                                                                                 The navigation display shows more information, such as next turn street and speed limit, and the picture update is smooth instead of jerky as I have seen in other models .\\n8                                                                              Finally, be carefull around Washington DC, because this unit has not updated the actual and latest detours arownd monuments and buildings, therefore taking you to dead ends

                                I avoided the more complex ones as I had read that FM updates can confuse the device and changing directions after the obstruction has been cleared is not a good option

                I updated to the latest 2010 map soon after I received the unit, so the map is accurate to me .\\n36

                                  I plan to wait almost the full 60 days to get the latest update, then probably never purchase an update .\\n47

have corrected that .\\n52

coffee breakfast restaurant across the street from the tube stop on Gloucester Road that served a good English breakfast at a decent price .\\n51

get the worst rooms because the price was so good but got a great room on the 16th floor facing the London Eye .\\n53

booking until you actually processed the booking and paid for the room ,  this is apparently now normal for many London hotels which I'd never experienced before ,  we ended up paying \\u00a317 more

was an empty fridge which came quite handy for our own beverages, I doubt they would have milk in their minibar  ,  Tea and coffee making facilites and iron with board were a great bonus to what we

work in some units .\\n38

                                                             Upon our arrival, there was a SLIGHT odor in bathroom but nothing worth complaining about .\\n43                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The bathroom was adequate with thick, fluffy towels .\\n44

        The bathroom was large and private .\\n45                                                                                                                                                                                                              The bathroom was very clean and well appointed with nice towels and toiletries, it was not big, but room enough to do what one needs to .\\n46                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The Tuscan Inn room was quite nicely appointed, the bed was comfortable the chairs   TV adequate, the bathroom reasonably good .\\n47

improvise, which was kind of surprising since the bathrooms were all redone on 2005 .\\n48                                                                                                                     The clever use of mirrors behind the bed helped to create the illusion of space, however, in reality the room was cramped and with two of us trying to use the hand basin and bathroom at the same time was particularly awkward .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The bathroom containing the toilet and the shower was also very small, not to mention the sink and counter directly outside of it .\\n50   Turning the bathroom light on also turns the counter light on, meaning a middle, of, the, night trip to the bathroom means the whole side of the room gets illuminated  and the wooden shutters that were installed in place of traditional curtains to add to the hotel's theme do absolutely nothing to keep the room dark once the sun comes up .\\n51

               The room was a good size but the bathroomm was very small .\\n52

there was a hairdryer .\\n53                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     The wash basin was in the room without any privacy and there was a small bathroom for the toilet and bath shower .\\n54                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The bathroom had not been remodeled in alignment, but it was all very clean and perfectly acceptable .\\n55

                           The bathroom had several problems .\\n56

very nice .\\n57

room which had a view of a wall, a tiny bathroom so small in fact that the sink had to be in the bedroom .\\n59

                                               We may have had an ADA room because it was pretty big with large bathroom ,  it was room 459 ,  and the room had all the amenities we were looking for

                                                                                                                                                         The only possible complaint was that the sink in the bathroom had a crack in it, but it did not bother me enough to ask for a different room .\\n63

     Some rooms had the bathroom sink outside the bathroom, which we would have preferred, but our sink was inside the bathroom .\\n70

home because there was a website selling the shampoo listed on the bottle .\\n71

the room was the bathroom, it was not up to the standard of the rest of the decor but it was clean and large enough .\\n74

the $40 pp .\\n12                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 So if you move around bottles in the fridge so that you can store your own food personal items, the sensor will send a signal to the hotel and you will be charged .\\n13

room service arrives even faster than they predict in their estimates .\\n17

             I have in the past called Guest Services for the loan of a mini, fridge which was previously installed in the room with no problem  this time round, I was told there was a flat US$50 fee for this, irrespective of the duration of the stay .\\n20                                                                                                                                                   Also worth mentioning is that this can be quite a 'conference' destination which can make things very busy if you are staying during one of these events  service can be slow and erratic, and the wait for elevators can be long and frustrating !\\n21

staff were extremely friendly and cheerful .\\n22

service the room until late afternoon .\\n23

town for four days from Los Angeles to catch a game at Wrigley Stadium, and the front desk and bar staff were all very friendly and accommodating, providing recommendations to us about the attractions, and transportation services .\\n25                                                                                                                                                                    Overall, I think the Swissotel is a perfectly nice facility and I feel like we got a good deal but I would never consider paying full price to stay there as you can get the same amenities and service at lower rates elsewhere .\\n26

                                                                                                                                                                                                 The staff at this hotel make you feel so welcome and its service with a smile .\\n28                                                                                                         All the staff go the extra mile to assist in anyway they can and the staff of the ajoining Cafe Pescatore are just as welcoming, with great service and the food is excellent .\\n29                                                                                                                                                                                        We ate at the Italian restaraunt located in the hotel and the food and service was outstanding .\\n30

                                                                                                                                                                              Service was all good, albeit a bit stoic .\\n32                                                                                                                                            Unfortunately we didn't get to dine in the hotel restaurant, but I'd say it would be good, if the after hours service is anything to go by !\\n33                                                                                                                                                      I'd highly recommend the Tuscan Inn based on location, cheerfulness of staff, aesthetics in the room and general overall service .\\n34

desk could not have been more helpful and whilst we did not avail his services, the concierge always seemed to be busy with guests giving info and advice .\\n36                                                                                                                                                                         There was also a gentleman offering massage at this time and we met a few people who had enjoyed his services .\\n37

service .\\n39                                                                                                                                                                               There are many public transportation options including the cable cars, the trolley line and bus service .\\n40                                                                                                                                                  The highlight of this hotel for us was the service offered by the staff, particularly the two concierges on duty while we were there .\\n41                                                                                                                                                                                                       Their service was of the level and knowledge I would expect at at 5, star hotel .\\n42                                                     One day we had the do not disturb sign on the door before the maid had come so we could rest, and when we finally stepped out for about an hour, we changed the sign for maid service and everything was perfect when we returned !\\n43                                                                                                            Amenities ,  While this hotel isn't a luxury property, they have some nice touches like marble bathrooms, mini bar, room service and an evening wine reception every day   .\\n44                                                                                                               At this point I asked to be put through to Best Western Customer Services and amazingly our room was changed to a king bed suite as per our reservation within the hour .\\n45

than 6 .\\n46                                                                                                                             We dined as a party of 4 and were still hit with this and then the waitress failed to hand over $10 of change taking this as an additional service charge .\\n47

                  The concierge service is second to none .\\n49                                                                                                                                          Tuscan Inn has it all, exellant location,very close to public transport, very clean, impeccable, friendly service and a supermarket opposite .\\n50                                                                                                                                               We found a great breakfast place just around the corner in Taylor St, called Darren's Cafe, good prices with excellant food and service .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                    Valet parking for $40 per night seems a bit steep,but at least the service was efficient and quick .\\n52

.\\n53                                                                                                                                                                                          The hotel makes a big thing of the coffee bisc service in the morning,and this is quite nice .\\n54

                                                                                                                                                                                                       Did not eat at the restaurant, but room service was great .\\n56                                                                                                                                                                                      Overall, the stay at The Tuscan Inn was great and would highly recommend due to the room service .\\n57

do not offer room service .\\n58

                                                                The restaurant in the hotel ,  Cafe Pescatore ,  does the breakfast run for room service, it was adequate but a little overpriced .\\n60                                                                                                         Lunch and dinner room service is provided by North Beach Pizza, which deliveries many Italian specialties including pasta, entrees, salads, sandwiches and of course ,  pizza .\\n61                                                                                                                           However, there are countless restaurants of all sorts and price ranges within a 1, 4 block walk of this hotel, there is little reason to order room service .\\n62

thought it was nice that it was available if needed .\\n63                                                                                                                      We did not eat at the hotel restaurant, we chose to eat at the IHOP around the corner for breakfast and it was good food and service, and they are open 24 hours .\\n64

loved my daughter's Civic and the dealer service is fantastic, but even good service can't help the uncomfortable seats .\\n10

pain after 20 minutes of driving !\\n11                                                                                                                                                                                              Although it is fun to drive and quality seems ok, the leather seats are very uncomfortable, especially on a long drive .\\n12

exterior design, and thus far it has been extremely reliable .\\n13

seats .\\n16

under front seats, and better tilt .\\n18                                                                                                                                                                                                          I can also fit three car seats in the back which was the reason I was able to go back the the Honda family .\\n19                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The seats are very comfortable & supportive .\\n20

                                                                                                                                                                                               This Accord has more road noise than I like and the seats tend to be hard, unlike my other Accords .\\n22                                                                                                                  Engine performance lacks punch after 60, head rest are poor design, lacks driver seat memory rear seat a c, radio system is marginal compared to Bose, Seats are hard and small for a large person .\\n23                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        The seats are comfortable, and there is ample leg room in the front and rear .\\n24

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The seat cover was coming out in between the seats .\\n29                                                                                                                              The only for sure complaint I have is the seats seems to hurt my back after I drove for a period of time, this may be because I am use to my silverado truck with leather bucket seats .\\n30                 DON'T rely on your test drive, the seats are Very uncomfortable and when the engine goes into the  econo  mode the vehicle  shifts rocks violently  forward and when leaving the  econo  mode it shifts rocks forward once again which means that the vehicle is  CONTINUOUSLY  SHAKING AND ROCKING .\\n31                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Seats are very comfortable and ride is very smooth !\\n32

uncomfortable after anything more than 15 minutes of driving due to what I see as a design flaw, the seat curvature is too great, and even with the lumbar support all the way retracted, it still feels like there is some type of bar sticking out in the wrong part of my back   .\\n34                                                                                                                However, long, distance comfort  is poor due to hard, narrow and deeply, bucketed seats combined with a very taut suspension which transmits even minor road imperfections through the whole vehicle .\\n35                                                                                                                                                  At first the seats seemed stiffer than I'd like, but after making a 2 1 2 hour trip, It felt very comfortable once I got the seat and lumbar adjusted to my liking .\\n36

the seats a very supportive .\\n37

                                                                                                                                                                                                            Ride is very good, but seats are just a little firm .\\n39

after anything more than 15 minutes of driving due to what I see as a design flaw, the seat curvature is too great, and even with the lumbar support all the way retracted, it still feels like there is

                  1 inch screens, Windows XP operating systems, a plethora of USB ports, a card reader, WiFi and most have a few color choices .\\n5

                                                 1 inch screens are a bit cramped if several toolbars have been turned on .\\n6

the machine have not been all that useful and some border on being advertisements for buying Asus stuff .\\n7                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Two other things that make this a superior computer are battery life, and the LED backlighting for the screen .\\n8                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The ways the screen opens   enables a smaller footprint when the case is closed, although it limits how far back the screen will tilt .\\n9

when dealing with one demanding internet site .\\n10                                                                                                                                                                                                The light weight, the battery life, the keyboard, the non, protruding removable battery, the bright screen, the track pad disable button and general ease of use makes it hard to beat .\\n11                                                                                                                                                                                                                      I recommend minimizing the size of the scroll zones on the right and bottom, other wise you find the screen suddenly scrolling when you did not want it to do so .\\n12                                                                                                                                                                                                                        zoom in or zoom out of a screen  , but on occasion it will zoom when you don't want or expect it to because of an inadvertent gesture or touch by a thumb, etc .\\n13                                                                                                                                                                                                        The occasional blue screen of death unfortunately has not gone away  Microsoft attributes it to an errant driver, but I have not been able to isolate what driver is the cause .\\n14

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 There are 2 bios updates and the latest is for a brighter screen setting .\\n16

This makes the screen much brighter and as with all new computers it seems there are always important updates .\\n17

web browser and push the f11 key the browser becomes full screen, helpful on a small screen .\\n18

Now I keep getting the  blue screen  serious errors .\\n20

is your leading consideration, then one of these may be for you, but for just a bit more money you get a much better screen, better battery life, bigger drive, more upgradeable, etc .\\n24

doesn't go back far enough .\\n32

magnet .\\n33                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        On full screen display is smooth and no issues .\\n34                                                                                                                                                                                                       Some iTunes content is a little laggy if it is maximized display, but not full screen for some reason, but switching to full screen display has taken care of that issue for me .\\n35                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              And with a two, fingered gesture on the scratchpad, you can enlarge or shrink the screen .\\n36              It won't give you all the functionality of a full, sized laptop, and the small screen may take some getting used to, but no regular laptop gives you this kind of battery life, and most of the functions absent here aren't used by most people most of the time anyway, so if the tradeoff is fewer features for greatly, increased battery life, I'll take the latter .\\n37

                              On a full charge, with wireless on, screen brightness on medium, I get a reported 8 .\\n38

surfing was no problem with plenty of screen real estate .\\n41

well as the screen off function key .\\n42

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     I'd far rather have this beautifully crisp screen and make the occasional adjustment for glare, than deal with a matte screen 24 7 .\\n46                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  One of the other complaints I'd come across is how for some, the screen doesn't tilt back far enough .\\n47

                                            yeah, you'd probably want the screen to tilt far enough back to lay flat .\\n48                                                            And if you can't wait to twist yourself into some contortion in bed where you need the screen to go back further than reasonable, you can always invest in one of those $20 lap desks ,  you know, the kind with the beanbag bottom, so that you can shift the desk into whatever ridiculous position will suit your fancy .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  and I could have gotten a matte screen, but neither of those  features  impressed me .\\n50

needs and seems about as fast as my 5, year, old IBM laptop .\\n51

although it normally recovered from that .\\n52

screen fine .\\n54                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The screen is too small for any meaningful work, but the apps DO work .\\n55                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Again, the screen is too small for this to be anything more than just satisfying from a purchase standpoint .\\n56                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             like others have said, it is definitely a fingerprint magnet, and the glossy screen can be a bit of a problem in some lighting conditions .\\n57

about as far as the screen brightness goes because my screen is far too bright at the higher end of the spectrum .\\n69

 It is a fingerprint magnet, and because of the glossy screen, its very reflective of light .\\n70

don't know why they use the screen size most do ,  1024 x 600 seems cramped\\n71

excellent, with normal usage I can get about 7 hours easily, more if I turn off WIFI and turn down the screen brightness .\\n89   One of the downside I have noticed is that the netbook is heavy near the hinge because that's where the battery is located and if you want to put it on your lap while sitting, you have to put your hand on the bottom chassis so that the netbook doesn't tip over, and the screen doesn't bend all the way backwards which can be annoy, otherwise this is a really nice netbook .\\n90

with a low squint factor and a keyboard that wasn't too cramped .\\n92

never needing to use it   .\\n94                                                                                                                                                                                                               And it goes in that bag wrapped in the white paper plastic bag it was originally boxed up in, with another piece of packing plastic between the keyboard and the

this is the case for other netbooks at this price point .\\n134                                                                                                                                                                                      I have not done an actual test of the full battery life but from what iv seen in general use it has around 9 hours while running wifi and other applications with around half screen brightness .\\n135

  Due to the size of netbooks and a wide screen format, the screen should have been designed to be able to rotate all the way back to inline with the keyboard .\\n139

      The 10, inch screen is bright and has good color, and the keyboard is only slightly smaller than a regular one .\\n141

good, screen very good, wireless very good, numerous USB ports, and keyboard layout is excellent .\\n142                                                                                                                                             It boots up quickly, especially after getting rid of the extra asus software that auto, boots at startup, its battery life is phenomenal, the screen is clear and easy to read, the keyboard is comfortable to type on and feels natural .\\n143                                                                                                                                               But even with that, and the glossy screen, fingerprint magnet, limited screen tilt, tinny speakers, and intermittent odd glitches, I still think it's a great value and would buy it again today if I were on the market for a netbook .\\n144

                         Instead I convert DVDs to DVIX AVI files using Fair Use Wizard and load them on to memory slot card and they play great, 700mb files look fine on this size of screen .\\n148

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    I have more productivity  flow  on a conventional laptop with a full sized screen and keyboard .\\n161

netbook screen must be scrolled up and down since it's a  chopped  1024 x 600 height screen, instead of the more usual 786 .\\n162

of a large order maintenance screen can require you to have to break the flow of productivity to scroll .\\n163

                                 The small screen is probably the biggest drawback .\\n164

aspect ration on the screen It flattens it to make more visible .\\n165

using full screen mode on browser with F11 .\\n166

needed on this small screen .\\n167

go back .\\n168                                                                                                                                                                                           Because the screen is so small in order to get the standard 1024x 768 display without having to scroll the normal screen the screen has to be  smashed  so the display is slightly altered .\\n169                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            One hint ,  there's a setting that lets you  compress  the screen which makes everything smaller and allows you to fit more on the screen .\\n170                                                                                                                                                                                                           I mostly find that when I make typos, it's not because of the keyboard, it's because of the smallness of the screen, , I just can't see what I'm doing as well as a laptop .\\n171

maybe it's something I need to figure out how to fix, but I don't like the aspect ratio of the screen either .\\n173

than onceThe decor is also fairly dated, with a 1970s feel to some of the public areas ,  the lounge bar has the ability to be good but is often used as a waiting area by people, occupying tables without having a drink, and doesnt work as some bars in lobby areas do at other hotels ,  the main bar is like a pub, and doesnt feel like part of the hotel .\\n104

the food .\\n45                                                                                                                                                                   There's an escalator that goes into the basement where you'll find a nice upscale restaurant and a long walkway concourse that leads to an underground mini, mall, with a grocery store, fast, food restaurants, barber shop etc .\\n46  , followed shortly thereafter by a knock and a housekeeper telling us our sign wasn't out  the hotel's extremely limited cable service    our housekeeper didn't refill replace our shampoo or shower gel our entire stay, nor did she empty all of our trash bins at any one time  our room service on two occasions brought us cold soggy, , and very late, , food  the lobby bar closes at 9 p .\\n47
