the service was adequate .\\n There were no service issues to speak of, but it's not an overly, friendly hotel .\\nGood Location Horrible Service Disgusting Procedures .\\nIf you're looking for a full, service experience, this is still not the hotel for you .\\nThe Holiday Inn Kensington Forum is fine if you like large, impersonal hotels with mediocre service, overcrowded breakfast rooms and don't mind tired decor .\\nWe found the front desk service unfriendly and indifferent .\\nGreat stay friendly service great location .\\n A prompt reply indicated not and that the reception area deposit boxes were temporarily out of service, so they offered to upgrade our rooms to executive rooms at no extra cost .\\nIn London its often hard to find good location and good customer service in the same place ,  The Holiday Inn Kensington Forum did that for me and I couldn't ask for more .\\n Breakfast was good, with many choices and excellent service .\\n Service in all areas, at all levels was good .\\n It's rated 4, stars, but I also stayed at an equivalently rated Marriott while in London, and a 3, star Holiday Inn Express in Scotland, and the service and rooms were much better at the other locations .\\n Maid service was good and the staff were always pleasant .\\n At the reception the service were exelent ,  altought during that five minutes I was standing there, the receptionists appologised three times !\\nGood Location New Room Bad Service  .\\n The only cleanliness complaint is the cleaning service did not remove dirty glasses or a decaying lemon wedge with the in room kettle service .\\n I am recommending the Forum despite the service problems .\\nPoor serviceNot friendly assistance .\\n It is not 4 star hotel service .\\nConvenient location not 4, star room and services but OK .\\nROOM and SERVICE ,  our room was obviously not one of the renovated ones .\\nService was a joke , ,  the  evening concierge  doubled as the day doorman and was not very knowledgeable about anything , ,  honestly, the last thing I want to hear when I ask about cool pubs to go to is  why don't you go to the bar in the hotel ?\\n Service impersonal but friendly .\\n Did not use any of the hotels other services, but I was pleased overall and would stay here again .\\n They also have a great room service menu and was surprised at the big portions and quality of the food, great to get a bit in your room after a night on the town .\\n We arrived at 11 am, but were able to check in with the professional and service, minded staff right away .\\n Someone needs to help those folks with a refresher course in customer service .\\n Near a tube station that services three subway lines, for starters .\\nWe are low maintenance so we didn't have to request service much, but when we did it was fine .\\nNot too happy with the service from frontdesk, concierge and housekeeping .\\n I ordered room service one night, and the food was delightful, and the service was fast and friendly .\\n If you need a hotel with services like access to a computer or a concierge who can do more than give directions and order full price tickets to events then don't stay here .\\n However the hotel is very large and loses some personal service as a result ,  the service we received was variable, with little recognition of our Platinum Priority Club Rewards status, and slow room service   .\\n For a little extra money, the soon to be Crowne Plaza over the road offers far better service yet with the same great location\\n Only postive is their breakfast service .\\nConvenient location Great Concierge service .\\n I would definitely stay here again for the location and the great customer service .\\n Talking about food, something worth noticing is that there was a fridge in the room, but it was completely reserved for the mini, bar service beverages, which completely filled it .\\n The service was the worst service we have EVER recieved in my life the worst .\\n30am, service finished at 11am, there was a queue for the toasters and the cooked breakfast was uninspiring ,  the ingredients seemed poor quality .\\nRoom service is expensive but good, the food was delivered hot and was tasty but was chosen from the current uninspired Holiday Inn room service menu, when I ordered a \\u00a36 .\\n, but after I called room service it was promptly fixed .\\nThere are no bottle openers or cork screws in the room so ask room service for them if you need them .\\n There is also a laundry service at the hotel, but they also change an outrageous amount so unless you have an expense account I wouldn't plan on using it .\\n Reception was busy but service was good throughout my stay .\\n But there are much better hotels to choose from for the same price and at least you get some good service and respect from staff .\\n The room and bathroom were very clean and serviced each day to a high standard .\\n The main restaurant is on floor 1 and offers a full cooked and continental buffet was good choice and generally very good service .\\nIf you're looking for a comfortable, clean hotel with a mid, range level of service and easy access, then this hotel would serve you well .\\n We ate on evening once at the Garfunkels pub in the mall, it was typical chain restaurant food but fast with good service .\\n Did not use any other facilities or order room service .\\n There was an adequate self service buffet, not a huge selection or very well presented, cloths were not changed when food got spilt .\\nExceptionally poor ,  and surprising ,  service .\\nGreat location service questionable .\\n Our room was clean, though small, the service was great, and we would stay here again in a heartbeat !\\nI liked this hotel, Nice big room and very good customer service .\\n Front, line staff members speak very poor English, and provide VERY poor customer service   .\\n Poor customer service, bad and overpriced pub food .\\n Room service took 15 minutes, which shocked me .\\n We were very pleased with the room, and the staff was all very nice and helpful, including the concierge service .\\n If you hang around in the lobby, you can hear other people complaining about poor service, poor room quality and a host of other problems to the staff .\\nbut be prepared for some poor service quality .\\n Service can be slow at peak times with waits up to one hour at times, but on average I had to wait no longer that around 30 minutes .\\n The food was excellent, the service was very friendly and the prices cheap .\\n The food is excellent and the service great .\\nService was friendly, our room was on the highest floor  , but that wasn't a problem because of the lifts, and we had a great view of the city from the room .\\n but after having spent an entire week in London, I came to realize that just about anybody in the service industry is just that .\\n Service was impeccably English hotel, wide .\\n The breakfast is self service on the first floor, not cheap   but not bad either as there is plenty of choice .\\n The card which is left for you to leave comments and review your service went missing from my room on the fourth day which speaks volumes .\\n The service is pleasant enough, and I was given a room with a nice view of central London   on the 14th floor without having to ask, despite booking on Priceline .\\n This is suppose to be a full service hotle, but I would only classify it at best as a Motel 6 quality .\\n Service at reception both for checking in or out can be slow and although I've always found the staff to be pleasant, not all of them fully understand english .\\n The buffet breakfast is ok although not the best I've had and usually includes a selection of fresh fruit as well as the usual 'full english' The food in the ground floor restaurant is good  I haven't had problems with room service although the menu has recently changed and doesn't have as good a selection as it did .\\n On the first night of my stay, I tried to use room service .\\n On the third night I tried room service again .\\n Room service pesonnel called me up after about 45minutes asking if I really needed the stuff that I had ordered .\\nthe atmosphere is such that they are always right and that a customer is doing them a service by staying at the hotel .\\n Is this the level of customer service you want ?\\nOn my last day I used the concierge service to arrange a cab for me .\\nIf you use wake up call service .\\n I think that is bad service .\\n There is a shuttle service for 34 pounds which needs to be booked one day ahead and plys only every half hour .\\nGreat location indifferent service .\\nI would stay here again because in London it really is a value for the service and quality of room .\\n Despite its size, and the fact that there are over 20 floors of bedrooms, lift service was never slow, and the breakfast operation   is exceptionally well, managed .\\n The maid service was good and everything was cleaned and tidied .\\n We ate at a really good Indian, very popular, good service plenty to eat for about \\u00a37 each .\\nBasic clean lodging service lacking .\\n   The internet service which costs GBP15 per day is slower than dial, up  !\\nGood room poor service all round .\\nBut those who put an emphasis on service quality should avoid this hotel .\\n The rude and poor service started from the concierge who was curt when I asked a question .\\n The service at the breakfast room was ok .\\n The only down side was the same as last time, very impersonal service by the Management and the on, duty Manager was just pure rude, but if you don't have to talk to any staff members, this hotel is great .\\nStayed in room 516 right at the end of the corridor was next to a services room from which there was a constant generator   fan noise .\\n We passed a number of banks on the way up and also a large post office offering currency etc which should give better rates than the hotels in, house money changing service .\\n There is 24 hour room service, a restaurant, and a tavern in the hotel although we did not sample the hotel food .\\n In all, as with many Holiday Inns hotels worldwide, affordable with good rooms and customer service but there is always one or two issues that keep this chain from being a affordable and good place to stay .\\n The fridge was self, service   and barely functional, so didn't chill the sodas I bought .\\n The immediate area around the hotel is extremely well serviced by at least 3 internet cafes, grocery store next to tube station, as well as several nice cafes and restaurants .\\n ASK is a very nice Italian restaurant nearby serving pastas and pizzas with excellent service which will run about 10\\n If you are looking for a bit more comfort and better service, look elsewhere .\\n Although we did get a strange phone call from room service at 1am, wrong number i think .\\nWell, located and good service .\\n In spite of its size, we found the service to be good ,  speedy check, in, and very rapid response to a broken toilet at 11pm .\\n Minimall with Boots pharmacy, Whole Foods type ritzy fullservice market, coffee shops, etc .\\n The hotel offers a laundry service which I needed to take advantage of .\\n However the service was quite efficient  my pants were brought back the same day .\\n It was clean and serviced promptly every day with fresh linen and towels .\\ncom and their 'top secret hotels' service .\\n Service was great and the concierge was very helpful .\\nExcellent location shame about the service !\\nWhen we wanted to watch a pay per view movie, was informed by reception there was a problem ,  it later transpired that we had been given an Aircrew room, where there is no mini, bar, pay per view movies turned off at reception, no menu's or room service available .\\n Also we were later informed that only executive rooms had the service of mini bar !\\n The maid service was excellent and we felt very happy with our choice .\\nWe took a private car service from airport to hotel, and it cost 55 pounds .\\nDon't use the restaurant or room service, there's plenty of places to eat outside the hotel, there's a mini Tesco for groceries, a larger grocery store   plenty of internet cafe's, a Paul's Boulangerie right by the tube, great fro a quick breakfast, the Gloucester Road tube stop is a 3 minute walk, plenty of busses to High Street fabulous shopping !\\n My daugher and I average about $70 a dinner regardless of whehter we ate out or did room service ,  ,  YIKES .\\n Service is not particularly attentive, but not rude .\\n Stunning food, amazing service .\\nGreat service and perfect location !\\n For the price, cleanliness, service and quality it definately deserves a higher star rating .\\nI wish that the hotel had better service, however .\\n To get ice, you have to first get a bucket from room service .\\n To get Room Service, it called Housekeeping .\\nFor a similarly good location  , you can stay at the London Hilton Metropole for the same price and receive much better service .\\n Quite snooty or surly service at reception, from two separate people .\\nStaff were mostly ethnic origin, presenting a couple of communication problems at check in   room service was slow and fairly bland   and we noticed a lack of acknowledgement by any staff as we walked around the premises, again unusual for such a high profile company .\\n I stayed in room 354 ,  on the Exec Floor ,  no bathrobes, no newspaper delivery  , room service crockery standing outside room for almost 24 hours un movedand poor service in Bistro .\\n We had room service the night we arrived, and it was good quality, and arrived quickly .\\n Super dinner and attentive service .\\n Food was OK, service very haphazard .\\n It is very close to Gloucester Rd tube station, has plenty of restaurants, pubs, supermarkets, chemists within 100 yds, is close to Hyde park for a run walk in summer, near Kensington High street, rooms are always clean and have recently been refurbed, room service menu is better than other hotel chains, breakfast is good .\\nWe had one evening meal in the ground floor restaurant, well cooked again, but the service was very slow .\\n Finally, the hotel did nothing to inform us about a transit strike on the tube and when we heard about it on our own and asked the concierge for help with getting to the airport, he advised taking a cab service for 50 pounds plus banking holiday surcharge, , we luckily found a cheaper alternative by ourselves .\\n The included breakfeast was a plus and I noticed the wifi folks using the free service in the lobby .\\n I noticed on my last stay that the quality of service was very diminished .\\n We were on the 20th floor   very happy with the rooms   the service .\\n I can say that every time I have been disappointed with either the value, standards, cleanliness,service of the hotel .\\n The food was good and the service was very good .\\nExcellent location and service .\\n Concierge was very helpful  we didnt take the English breakfast but the downstairs bar offers croissants and Starbucks coffee and the service was very nice .\\n Service was efficient but far from personal, how could it be when the place was as a large as it was !\\n It met all my expectations ,  very clean room w pleasing modern decor, above average housekeeping services, accomodating staff .\\nAdditionally, one other problem was that room service was very very inefficient ,  requesting a menu to be brought to the room took 45 minutes and the guy actually had the audacity to suggest he read it to me over the phone instead of sending one up, after I had to call three times .\\n Room service will bring a bucket of ice any time, or there\\u0092s a machine on the 25th floor .\\n Typical London impersonal service from staff .\\nExcellent location service cleanliness and price at the Holiday Inn Kensington Forum .\\n All in all great location ,  nice restaurants nearby, nicely pitched service .\\nWhat brings down my rating for the hotel is their service .\\n I still can't figure out if it's a difference in  service  from US and UK standards or if it's just this hotel .\\n Good concierge service ,  recommended very good restaurants ,  italian and indian ,  to us ,  in walking distance from the hotel .\\n The hotel staff are very helpful and provided excellent service .\\n We used room service one night and it was excellent .\\n Food quality was good, service prompt, everything prepared as we had ordered .\\n The service was great with lots of coffee and tea and toast brought to the table for you .\\n The price is moderate for the service and the location .\\n The price, the space, the location and the service were the exactly right thing we wanted .\\nThis hotel is located in an excellent area of London and is just around the corner from Gloucester St tube station which has excellent service to all the tourist sites .\\n Fantastic, professional, helpful staff, clean rooms, great room service, fitness area and Internet Business facilities keep me coming back .\\n Great location, freshly renovated, very small rooms, anonymous hotel, acceptable service .\\n because it has sensor to count how many times you open it for beverage service, nice area, near Starbucks, pastry shops, fast foods, supermarket, walking distances to Kensington Palace, London Natural Science Museum, Harrods, Victoria Albert Musuem, pubs, and what else could you ask for .\\n My family stayed in 2 connecting rooms this July and had outstanding customer service .\\n, We booked our room through an internet service and was lodged in an executive room that included all the aminities expected in a 5, star hotel !\\n We also love the service of the staff, not to foreget the kindly people which store our bags .\\nI was very disappointed with the service from this huge hotel .\\n Service was great and the location of the hotel was very convenient   .\\n Be cautious of using the room services like the phone, mini bar and room service as the prices are sky high, but I would definitely stay there again and I would recommend this hotel to anyone !\\n\",\n          \"Windows 7 is quite simply faster, more stable, boots faster, goes to sleep faster, comes back from sleep

5 stars Windows 7 runs slower than Vista, December 15, 2009\\nSince putting Windows 7 on my computer, the computer runs much slower than it did with Vista .\\nSo I just got the Windows 7 upgrade installed  , and I was instantly amazed at how fast and sleek everything looked .\\nSimply put, Windows 7 looks amazing, and is fast and intuitive .\\n I started to upload a youtube video, went away to have breakfast and came back to a blue screen of death .\\n\",\n          \"  The voice prompts and maps are wonderful especially when driving after dark .\\nI also thought the the voice prompts of the 750 where more pleasant sounding than the 255w's .\\n The 750 sounds more like a real female voice, where the 255w sounds more robotic .\\n I didn't have the problems with the sounds of the voices like others have .\\nSome of the voices are annoying .\\n My understanding is that Garmin really compressed the voice in this unit, far more than in previous units .\\n I like my older unit better ,  better voice quality and it simply tells you how far to the next turn and what direction to turn .\\n The quality of the voice   leaves a bit to be desired .\\nThe text to speech is great for not having to look down at the screen endangering yourself and others on the road and after the voice updates the Garmin put out for the 255W the scratchiness and robotic sounding voice became crisp and very audible .\\n I note that a competitor is coming out with a Homer Simpson version of the GPS voices .\\nI wish that the GPS had a remote control that allowed you to change screens without having to lean forward while driving, or better yet, responded to voice commands .\\nFirst I want to address the  potential problem  on 255w which is the robotic sound, I personally think it is absolutely understandable, the female sound is a little vauge at some point, however the man's   voice is very clear to me, so this is not a problem for me .\\nSome of the negatives that were mentioned that I did not find to be true were that you can't understand the voice   The possible list could go on and on but I think you get the idea .\\n The voice is somewhat robotic and some street names are mispronounced, but it's all understandable, I read comments in some reviews that the voice is not loud enough, but I have no problem   .\\n The text, to, speech is very good, with very clear voices .\\n You have your choice of several languages and voices .\\n Also, for no extra charge, you are able to download several voices and vehicles from the Garmin site .\\n For instance, you can change the voice of the GPS .\\nThe voice descriptions of the routes are clear and easily understood, even for me with a hearing loss .\\n At volumes of 60% or above, there is so much distortion that the voices sound like they are coming from a blown speaker .\\n It seems to be caused by Garmin decreasing the file sizes and quality of the voice files .\\n On previous models like the 350 and 360 the voice files were 100\\n Its almost impossible to understand the voice as its metallic tinny .\\n Many a times, this is a distraction as you will be wondering what the voice command said .\\n Other than the Magellan's screen being an inch smaller ,  but really noticeable ,  the Magellan did not have text to voice, and often would take a much longer route even though we told it to take freeways .\\nThe most noticeable thing is that the screen is much easier to read, and that the text to voice is extremely valuable and much better than a beep just as you need to turn .\\n And the voice and streets match perfectly .\\n the female voice   is much clearer than Jack, the male American English .\\n I couldn't understand the Australian or English voices, but Samantha is clear as a bell and can even be heard over the radio .\\n The screen is easy to see, the voice tells you where you are and it's very accurate .\\n When the voices are turned up loud enough for my satisfaction, the speakers sound like they are overpowered, making a distorted noise during the loudest parts of the system's voices .\\n It seems that the female voices do not distort quite as much as the male voices .\\n The voices seem too robotic .\\n However, I much prefer robotic voices to no spoken directions at all .\\n Everybody said the same thing, great unit, but poor voice in the TTS mode .\\n So I called Garmin and ask if any fix was comming out to fix the voice .\\n I bought the 255W and the voice was tinny and soft .\\n Voice commands were mechanical but clear .\\n I had no problem with the clarity of the voice system .\\n A clear voice tells me when the turns are coming up, as well as the names of the roads .\\n the unit takes you on weird routes and people don't like the TTS voice .\\n The user remarks on voice on saying the street name was important to me and easy use of device so too was important .\\nThe voice directions are great, but sometimes it mispronounces names .\\nThe default voice is extremely clear and easy to understand, so I never even tried any of the alternative voices .\\nI like being able to select different voices, however when I am using Daniel with the English accent, he seems to be clearing his throat at the end of his directions .\\nThe voice instructions given are clear, but as few people mentioned in their reviews, you need to get familiar with the pronunciation .\\nNot only the voice gives turn, by, turn instructions, the map on the screen also has a thick purple line indicating the route ahead .\\n This is a big help as I was essentially following that thick purple line while listening to the voice instructions to make sure I was make correct turns when in Buffalo .\\n Often when I'd get a phone call or was talking to someone, it would have been nice to just have the ability to quickly make the voice directions mute .\\n I have no problems reading it in bright sunlight, but with the voice to text, the screen is almost unnecessary .\\n I had read about concerns the voice prompts were not loud enough .\\n I also love the small things, such as being able to download new voices, and vehicles, I plan on getting all the vehicles has on their site, because there is one for every season, for every mood, every time of year .\\n The screen is crystal clear and the voice in it is nice and loud .\\n There are different voices you can choose to give you your directions, even Australian, American and British English .\\nI agree that the sound isn't great for the TTS voice but it's definitely audible and I like it over all .\\n The non TTS voice is more pleasant .\\n The only complaint that I have if you even want to call it that is that the text, to, speech voices sound pretty robotic .\\n You can also change the voice you hear and your vehicle type .\\n The Voice Prompted turn by turn directions make it easy to get from one place to another without having to look up at the GPS, but of course you also get turn, by, turn directions on the GPS with a touch of the screen .\\nThe unit worked well and I had no issue with the voice as I had my window up all the time and did not have the radio on .\\n I switched over to the male voice which I happen to like better .\\nThe screen is clear and the instructions are good though again if you have a lot of exits or turns all in the same spot you have to be careful to just listen to the voice and watch the road or you can miss the turn .\\nUnder the Services link on the Garmin site look for the Goodies section and The Garmin Garage link for extra car images and sometimes voices too .\\n The only complaint I have is that the voice is a little bit tinny especially if the volume is turned up .\\n The voice directions give you fair warning when you are about to take a turn, which is really important .\\n The voice is annoying as heck too, no personality .\\n The voice it has is clear and readable even for my 79 year old ears .\\nThe voice is clear and easy to understand .\\n Since my near vision isn't very good I like the combination of the voice prompts and the big white arrow indicating an approaching turn, especially at night .\\n0 out of 5 stars No Jill voice on this one !\\nI rated this item with 4 stars because it does not have Jill's voice and there's no way to put it in .\\n All the english voices you have suck big time, you will not like not even one and the new Samantha voice really sucks big time .\\n What they did was, they made new voice files a lot smaller that on the previous models and all the new voices sound like crap and there's no way to copy the voices from other devices like you use to with the previous models .\\n If you input an address on where you want to go, it tells you how to get there in very clear graphics and also with a computer voice that is not obnoxious to listen to .\\nI'm really glad I bought it though, and like the easy to read graphics, the voice used to tell you the name of the street you are to turn on, the uncannily accurate estimates of mileage and time of arrival at your destination .\\n Map is bright and detailed, voice directions are clear and loud  .\\nThe voice prompts  are mostly clear, sometimes quirky and the volume levels adequate .\\n The voice system gave ample time to make turns and lane changes .\\n Several voice options will announce both directions and street names, etc .\\n From reviews, I thought there might only be one voice .\\n The pre, installed english voice is a little robotic but if you switch to the british american it is perfect .\\n After ample research   I selected the Nuvi 255W for it's abundant features, wider screen and voice communication .\\nVOICE ACTIVATION DID STOP WORKING & THEN CAME BACK IN GERMAN ,  JUST CHANGED IT BACK ENGLISH & HAS BEEN WORKING WELL SINCE THEN .\\n Love that you can change the voice person talking on this one, my last one didn't do that .\\nOthers have said that the voice directions leave something to be desired in terms of volume and clarity .\\n I must say, though, that I believed it would have a certain cachet to use the British English female voice that is a standard feature but found that she could not properly pronounce some of the street names in my area .\\nThe voice commands are excellent and timely .\\n The model 255W that we received seemed to take longer to find a satelite, and the man's voice was very fast and not as clear, and at times seemed a bit confused in directions .\\n The voice is very clear and gives plenty of warning when we need to make a turn ahead .\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

the service was adequate .\\n There were no service issues to speak of, but it's not an overly, friendly hotel .\\nGood Location Horrible Service Disgusting Procedures .\\nIf you're looking for a full, service experience, this is still not the hotel for you .\\nThe Holiday Inn Kensington Forum is fine if you like large, impersonal hotels with mediocre service, overcrowded breakfast rooms and don't mind tired decor .\\nWe found the front desk service unfriendly and indifferent .\\nGreat stay friendly service great location .\\n A prompt reply indicated not and that the reception area deposit boxes were temporarily out of service, so they offered to upgrade our rooms to executive rooms at no extra cost .\\nIn London its often hard to find good location and good customer service in the same place ,  The Holiday Inn Kensington Forum did that for me and I couldn't ask for more .\\n Breakfast was good, with many choices and excellent service .\\n Service in all areas, at all levels was good .\\n It's rated 4, stars, but I also stayed at an equivalently rated Marriott while in London, and a 3, star Holiday Inn Express in Scotland, and the service and rooms were much better at the other locations .\\n Maid service was good and the staff were always pleasant .\\n At the reception the service were exelent ,  altought during that five minutes I was standing there, the receptionists appologised three times !\\nGood Location New Room Bad Service  .\\n The only cleanliness complaint is the cleaning service did not remove dirty glasses or a decaying lemon wedge with the in room kettle service .\\n I am recommending the Forum despite the service problems .\\nPoor serviceNot friendly assistance .\\n It is not 4 star hotel service .\\nConvenient location not 4, star room and services but OK .\\nROOM and SERVICE ,  our room was obviously not one of the renovated ones .\\nService was a joke , ,  the  evening concierge  doubled as the day doorman and was not very knowledgeable about anything , ,  honestly, the last thing I want to hear when I ask about cool pubs to go to is  why don't you go to the bar in the hotel ?\\n Service impersonal but friendly .\\n Did not use any of the hotels other services, but I was pleased overall and would stay here again .\\n They also have a great room service menu and was surprised at the big portions and quality of the food, great to get a bit in your room after a night on the town .\\n We arrived at 11 am, but were able to check in with the professional and service, minded staff right away .\\n Someone needs to help those folks with a refresher course in customer service .\\n Near a tube station that services three subway lines, for starters .\\nWe are low maintenance so we didn't have to request service much, but when we did it was fine .\\nNot too happy with the service from frontdesk, concierge and housekeeping .\\n I ordered room service one night, and the food was delightful, and the service was fast and friendly .\\n If you need a hotel with services like access to a computer or a concierge who can do more than give directions and order full price tickets to events then don't stay here .\\n However the hotel is very large and loses some personal service as a result ,  the service we received was variable, with little recognition of our Platinum Priority Club Rewards status, and slow room service   .\\n For a little extra money, the soon to be Crowne Plaza over the road offers far better service yet with the same great location\\n Only postive is their breakfast service .\\nConvenient location Great Concierge service .\\n I would definitely stay here again for the location and the great customer service .\\n Talking about food, something worth noticing is that there was a fridge in the room, but it was completely reserved for the mini, bar service beverages, which completely filled it .\\n The service was the worst service we have EVER recieved in my life the worst .\\n30am, service finished at 11am, there was a queue for the toasters and the cooked breakfast was uninspiring ,  the ingredients seemed poor quality .\\nRoom service is expensive but good, the food was delivered hot and was tasty but was chosen from the current uninspired Holiday Inn room service menu, when I ordered a \\u00a36 .\\n, but after I called room service it was promptly fixed .\\nThere are no bottle openers or cork screws in the room so ask room service for them if you need them .\\n There is also a laundry service at the hotel, but they also change an outrageous amount so unless you have an expense account I wouldn't plan on using it .\\n Reception was busy but service was good throughout my stay .\\n But there are much better hotels to choose from for the same price and at least you get some good service and respect from staff .\\n The room and bathroom were very clean and serviced each day to a high standard .\\n The main restaurant is on floor 1 and offers a full cooked and continental buffet was good choice and generally very good service .\\nIf you're looking for a comfortable, clean hotel with a mid, range level of service and easy access, then this hotel would serve you well .\\n We ate on evening once at the Garfunkels pub in the mall, it was typical chain restaurant food but fast with good service .\\n Did not use any other facilities or order room service .\\n There was an adequate self service buffet, not a huge selection or very well presented, cloths were not changed when food got spilt .\\nExceptionally poor ,  and surprising ,  service .\\nGreat location service questionable .\\n Our room was clean, though small, the service was great, and we would stay here again in a heartbeat !\\nI liked this hotel, Nice big room and very good customer service .\\n Front, line staff members speak very poor English, and provide VERY poor customer service   .\\n Poor customer service, bad and overpriced pub food .\\n Room service took 15 minutes, which shocked me .\\n We were very pleased with the room, and the staff was all very nice and helpful, including the concierge service .\\n If you hang around in the lobby, you can hear other people complaining about poor service, poor room quality and a host of other problems to the staff .\\nbut be prepared for some poor service quality .\\n Service can be slow at peak times with waits up to one hour at times, but on average I had to wait no longer that around 30 minutes .\\n The food was excellent, the service was very friendly and the prices cheap .\\n The food is excellent and the service great .\\nService was friendly, our room was on the highest floor  , but that wasn't a problem because of the lifts, and we had a great view of the city from the room .\\n but after having spent an entire week in London, I came to realize that just about anybody in the service industry is just that .\\n Service was impeccably English hotel, wide .\\n The breakfast is self service on the first floor, not cheap   but not bad either as there is plenty of choice .\\n The card which is left for you to leave comments and review your service went missing from my room on the fourth day which speaks volumes .\\n The service is pleasant enough, and I was given a room with a nice view of central London   on the 14th floor without having to ask, despite booking on Priceline .\\n This is suppose to be a full service hotle, but I would only classify it at best as a Motel 6 quality .\\n Service at reception both for checking in or out can be slow and although I've always found the staff to be pleasant, not all of them fully understand english .\\n The buffet breakfast is ok although not the best I've had and usually includes a selection of fresh fruit as well as the usual 'full english' The food in the ground floor restaurant is good  I haven't had problems with room service although the menu has recently changed and doesn't have as good a selection as it did .\\n On the first night of my stay, I tried to use room service .\\n On the third night I tried room service again .\\n Room service pesonnel called me up after about 45minutes asking if I really needed the stuff that I had ordered .\\nthe atmosphere is such that they are always right and that a customer is doing them a service by staying at the hotel .\\n Is this the level of customer service you want ?\\nOn my last day I used the concierge service to arrange a cab for me .\\nIf you use wake up call service .\\n I think that is bad service .\\n There is a shuttle service for 34 pounds which needs to be booked one day ahead and plys only every half hour .\\nGreat location indifferent service .\\nI would stay here again because in London it really is a value for the service and quality of room .\\n Despite its size, and the fact that there are over 20 floors of bedrooms, lift service was never slow, and the breakfast operation   is exceptionally well, managed .\\n The maid service was good and everything was cleaned and tidied .\\n We ate at a really good Indian, very popular, good service plenty to eat for about \\u00a37 each .\\nBasic clean lodging service lacking .\\n   The internet service which costs GBP15 per day is slower than dial, up  !\\nGood room poor service all round .\\nBut those who put an emphasis on service quality should avoid this hotel .\\n The rude and poor service started from the concierge who was curt when I asked a question .\\n The service at the breakfast room was ok .\\n The only down side was the same as last time, very impersonal service by the Management and the on, duty Manager was just pure rude, but if you don't have to talk to any staff members, this hotel is great .\\nStayed in room 516 right at the end of the corridor was next to a services room from which there was a constant generator   fan noise .\\n We passed a number of banks on the way up and also a large post office offering currency etc which should give better rates than the hotels in, house money changing service .\\n There is 24 hour room service, a restaurant, and a tavern in the hotel although we did not sample the hotel food .\\n In all, as with many Holiday Inns hotels worldwide, affordable with good rooms and customer service but there is always one or two issues that keep this chain from being a affordable and good place to stay .\\n The fridge was self, service   and barely functional, so didn't chill the sodas I bought .\\n The immediate area around the hotel is extremely well serviced by at least 3 internet cafes, grocery store next to tube station, as well as several nice cafes and restaurants .\\n ASK is a very nice Italian restaurant nearby serving pastas and pizzas with excellent service which will run about 10\\n If you are looking for a bit more comfort and better service, look elsewhere .\\n Although we did get a strange phone call from room service at 1am, wrong number i think .\\nWell, located and good service .\\n In spite of its size, we found the service to be good ,  speedy check, in, and very rapid response to a broken toilet at 11pm .\\n Minimall with Boots pharmacy, Whole Foods type ritzy fullservice market, coffee shops, etc .\\n The hotel offers a laundry service which I needed to take advantage of .\\n However the service was quite efficient  my pants were brought back the same day .\\n It was clean and serviced promptly every day with fresh linen and towels .\\ncom and their 'top secret hotels' service .\\n Service was great and the concierge was very helpful .\\nExcellent location shame about the service !\\nWhen we wanted to watch a pay per view movie, was informed by reception there was a problem ,  it later transpired that we had been given an Aircrew room, where there is no mini, bar, pay per view movies turned off at reception, no menu's or room service available .\\n Also we were later informed that only executive rooms had the service of mini bar !\\n The maid service was excellent and we felt very happy with our choice .\\nWe took a private car service from airport to hotel, and it cost 55 pounds .\\nDon't use the restaurant or room service, there's plenty of places to eat outside the hotel, there's a mini Tesco for groceries, a larger grocery store   plenty of internet cafe's, a Paul's Boulangerie right by the tube, great fro a quick breakfast, the Gloucester Road tube stop is a 3 minute walk, plenty of busses to High Street fabulous shopping !\\n My daugher and I average about $70 a dinner regardless of whehter we ate out or did room service ,  ,  YIKES .\\n Service is not particularly attentive, but not rude .\\n Stunning food, amazing service .\\nGreat service and perfect location !\\n For the price, cleanliness, service and quality it definately deserves a higher star rating .\\nI wish that the hotel had better service, however .\\n To get ice, you have to first get a bucket from room service .\\n To get Room Service, it called Housekeeping .\\nFor a similarly good location  , you can stay at the London Hilton Metropole for the same price and receive much better service .\\n Quite snooty or surly service at reception, from two separate people .\\nStaff were mostly ethnic origin, presenting a couple of communication problems at check in   room service was slow and fairly bland   and we noticed a lack of acknowledgement by any staff as we walked around the premises, again unusual for such a high profile company .\\n I stayed in room 354 ,  on the Exec Floor ,  no bathrobes, no newspaper delivery  , room service crockery standing outside room for almost 24 hours un movedand poor service in Bistro .\\n We had room service the night we arrived, and it was good quality, and arrived quickly .\\n Super dinner and attentive service .\\n Food was OK, service very haphazard .\\n It is very close to Gloucester Rd tube station, has plenty of restaurants, pubs, supermarkets, chemists within 100 yds, is close to Hyde park for a run walk in summer, near Kensington High street, rooms are always clean and have recently been refurbed, room service menu is better than other hotel chains, breakfast is good .\\nWe had one evening meal in the ground floor restaurant, well cooked again, but the service was very slow .\\n Finally, the hotel did nothing to inform us about a transit strike on the tube and when we heard about it on our own and asked the concierge for help with getting to the airport, he advised taking a cab service for 50 pounds plus banking holiday surcharge, , we luckily found a cheaper alternative by ourselves .\\n The included breakfeast was a plus and I noticed the wifi folks using the free service in the lobby .\\n I noticed on my last stay that the quality of service was very diminished .\\n We were on the 20th floor   very happy with the rooms   the service .\\n I can say that every time I have been disappointed with either the value, standards, cleanliness,service of the hotel .\\n The food was good and the service was very good .\\nExcellent location and service .\\n Concierge was very helpful  we didnt take the English breakfast but the downstairs bar offers croissants and Starbucks coffee and the service was very nice .\\n Service was efficient but far from personal, how could it be when the place was as a large as it was !\\n It met all my expectations ,  very clean room w pleasing modern decor, above average housekeeping services, accomodating staff .\\nAdditionally, one other problem was that room service was very very inefficient ,  requesting a menu to be brought to the room took 45 minutes and the guy actually had the audacity to suggest he read it to me over the phone instead of sending one up, after I had to call three times .\\n Room service will bring a bucket of ice any time, or there\\u0092s a machine on the 25th floor .\\n Typical London impersonal service from staff .\\nExcellent location service cleanliness and price at the Holiday Inn Kensington Forum .\\n All in all great location ,  nice restaurants nearby, nicely pitched service .\\nWhat brings down my rating for the hotel is their service .\\n I still can't figure out if it's a difference in  service  from US and UK standards or if it's just this hotel .\\n Good concierge service ,  recommended very good restaurants ,  italian and indian ,  to us ,  in walking distance from the hotel .\\n The hotel staff are very helpful and provided excellent service .\\n We used room service one night and it was excellent .\\n Food quality was good, service prompt, everything prepared as we had ordered .\\n The service was great with lots of coffee and tea and toast brought to the table for you .\\n The price is moderate for the service and the location .\\n The price, the space, the location and the service were the exactly right thing we wanted .\\nThis hotel is located in an excellent area of London and is just around the corner from Gloucester St tube station which has excellent service to all the tourist sites .\\n Fantastic, professional, helpful staff, clean rooms, great room service, fitness area and Internet Business facilities keep me coming back .\\n Great location, freshly renovated, very small rooms, anonymous hotel, acceptable service .\\n because it has sensor to count how many times you open it for beverage service, nice area, near Starbucks, pastry shops, fast foods, supermarket, walking distances to Kensington Palace, London Natural Science Museum, Harrods, Victoria Albert Musuem, pubs, and what else could you ask for .\\n My family stayed in 2 connecting rooms this July and had outstanding customer service .\\n, We booked our room through an internet service and was lodged in an executive room that included all the aminities expected in a 5, star hotel !\\n We also love the service of the staff, not to foreget the kindly people which store our bags .\\nI was very disappointed with the service from this huge hotel .\\n Service was great and the location of the hotel was very convenient   .\\n Be cautious of using the room services like the phone, mini bar and room service as the prices are sky high, but I would definitely stay there again and I would recommend this hotel to anyone !\\n\",\n          \"Windows 7 is quite simply faster, more stable, boots faster, goes to sleep faster, comes back from sleep

pretty fast .\\n Its faster to load, easier to use, and it has a new feature called the library where you can access all your related files in one window .\\n Performance wise it is slightly faster than Vista and I'm talking 10 to 15 seconds difference for starting the computer, other computers I have the run on Linux still start in less than 1 quarter the time that Windows 7 does .\\n If you

boot up faster than Vista, I do like the taskbar at the bottom as you can  pin  icons to start all of your programs and you can start a program with the desired file opening .\\nAlthough Win 7 seems a bit faster than Vista did, I do not notice any decrease in the start, up time .\\nIt may be that Win7 is faster, sounder, prettier, etc .\\n Yes the comp does boot a bit faster, but it's going to take a lot sequences to break even on the time spent so far .\\n It may or may not be a little faster .\\n W7 is fast and resource friendly, every hardware device works perfect  , and there's a ton of great features .\\n My system seems to be faster, all of my previous programs and peripherals run without a problem, things come up quicker when clicking on them and I love the new look .\\n How about

5 stars Windows 7 runs slower than Vista, December 15, 2009\\nSince putting Windows 7 on my computer, the computer runs much slower than it did with Vista .\\nSo I just got the Windows 7 upgrade installed  , and I was instantly amazed at how fast and sleek everything looked .\\nSimply put, Windows 7 looks amazing, and is fast and intuitive .\\n I started to upload a youtube video, went away to have breakfast and came back to a blue screen of death .\\n\",\n          \"  The voice prompts and maps are wonderful especially when driving after dark .\\nI also thought the the voice prompts of the 750 where more pleasant sounding than the 255w's .\\n The 750 sounds more like a real female voice, where the 255w sounds more robotic .\\n I didn't have the problems with the sounds of the voices like others have .\\nSome of the voices are annoying .\\n My understanding is that Garmin really compressed the voice in this unit, far more than in previous units .\\n I like my older unit better ,  better voice quality and it simply tells you how far to the next turn and what direction to turn .\\n The quality of the voice   leaves a bit to be desired .\\nThe text to speech is great for not having to look down at the screen endangering yourself and others on the road and after the voice updates the Garmin put out for the 255W the scratchiness and robotic sounding voice became crisp and very audible .\\n I note that a competitor is coming out with a Homer Simpson version of the GPS voices .\\nI wish that the GPS had a remote control that allowed you to change screens without having to lean forward while driving, or better yet, responded to voice commands .\\nFirst I want to address the  potential problem  on 255w which is the robotic sound, I personally think it is absolutely understandable, the female sound is a little vauge at some point, however the man's   voice is very clear to me, so this is not a problem for me .\\nSome of the negatives that were mentioned that I did not find to be true were that you can't understand the voice   The possible list could go on and on but I think you get the idea .\\n The voice is somewhat robotic and some street names are mispronounced, but it's all understandable, I read comments in some reviews that the voice is not loud enough, but I have no problem   .\\n The text, to, speech is very good, with very clear voices .\\n You have your choice of several languages and voices .\\n Also, for no extra charge, you are able to download several voices and vehicles from the Garmin site .\\n For instance, you can change the voice of the GPS .\\nThe voice descriptions of the routes are clear and easily understood, even for me with a hearing loss .\\n At volumes of 60% or above, there is so much distortion that the voices sound like they are coming from a blown speaker .\\n It seems to be caused by Garmin decreasing the file sizes and quality of the voice files .\\n On previous models like the 350 and 360 the voice files were 100\\n Its almost impossible to understand the voice as its metallic tinny .\\n Many a times, this is a distraction as you will be wondering what the voice command said .\\n Other than the Magellan's screen being an inch smaller ,  but really noticeable ,  the Magellan did not have text to voice, and often would take a much longer route even though we told it to take freeways .\\nThe most noticeable thing is that the screen is much easier to read, and that the text to voice is extremely valuable and much better than a beep just as you need to turn .\\n And the voice and streets match perfectly .\\n the female voice   is much clearer than Jack, the male American English .\\n I couldn't understand the Australian or English voices, but Samantha is clear as a bell and can even be heard over the radio .\\n The screen is easy to see, the voice tells you where you are and it's very accurate .\\n When the voices are turned up loud enough for my satisfaction, the speakers sound like they are overpowered, making a distorted noise during the loudest parts of the system's voices .\\n It seems that the female voices do not distort quite as much as the male voices .\\n The voices seem too robotic .\\n However, I much prefer robotic voices to no spoken directions at all .\\n Everybody said the same thing, great unit, but poor voice in the TTS mode .\\n So I called Garmin and ask if any fix was comming out to fix the voice .\\n I bought the 255W and the voice was tinny and soft .\\n Voice commands were mechanical but clear .\\n I had no problem with the clarity of the voice system .\\n A clear voice tells me when the turns are coming up, as well as the names of the roads .\\n the unit takes you on weird routes and people don't like the TTS voice .\\n The user remarks on voice on saying the street name was important to me and easy use of device so too was important .\\nThe voice directions are great, but sometimes it mispronounces names .\\nThe default voice is extremely clear and easy to understand, so I never even tried any of the alternative voices .\\nI like being able to select different voices, however when I am using Daniel with the English accent, he seems to be clearing his throat at the end of his directions .\\nThe voice instructions given are clear, but as few people mentioned in their reviews, you need to get familiar with the pronunciation .\\nNot only the voice gives turn, by, turn instructions, the map on the screen also has a thick purple line indicating the route ahead .\\n This is a big help as I was essentially following that thick purple line while listening to the voice instructions to make sure I was make correct turns when in Buffalo .\\n Often when I'd get a phone call or was talking to someone, it would have been nice to just have the ability to quickly make the voice directions mute .\\n I have no problems reading it in bright sunlight, but with the voice to text, the screen is almost unnecessary .\\n I had read about concerns the voice prompts were not loud enough .\\n I also love the small things, such as being able to download new voices, and vehicles, I plan on getting all the vehicles has on their site, because there is one for every season, for every mood, every time of year .\\n The screen is crystal clear and the voice in it is nice and loud .\\n There are different voices you can choose to give you your directions, even Australian, American and British English .\\nI agree that the sound isn't great for the TTS voice but it's definitely audible and I like it over all .\\n The non TTS voice is more pleasant .\\n The only complaint that I have if you even want to call it that is that the text, to, speech voices sound pretty robotic .\\n You can also change the voice you hear and your vehicle type .\\n The Voice Prompted turn by turn directions make it easy to get from one place to another without having to look up at the GPS, but of course you also get turn, by, turn directions on the GPS with a touch of the screen .\\nThe unit worked well and I had no issue with the voice as I had my window up all the time and did not have the radio on .\\n I switched over to the male voice which I happen to like better .\\nThe screen is clear and the instructions are good though again if you have a lot of exits or turns all in the same spot you have to be careful to just listen to the voice and watch the road or you can miss the turn .\\nUnder the Services link on the Garmin site look for the Goodies section and The Garmin Garage link for extra car images and sometimes voices too .\\n The only complaint I have is that the voice is a little bit tinny especially if the volume is turned up .\\n The voice directions give you fair warning when you are about to take a turn, which is really important .\\n The voice is annoying as heck too, no personality .\\n The voice it has is clear and readable even for my 79 year old ears .\\nThe voice is clear and easy to understand .\\n Since my near vision isn't very good I like the combination of the voice prompts and the big white arrow indicating an approaching turn, especially at night .\\n0 out of 5 stars No Jill voice on this one !\\nI rated this item with 4 stars because it does not have Jill's voice and there's no way to put it in .\\n All the english voices you have suck big time, you will not like not even one and the new Samantha voice really sucks big time .\\n What they did was, they made new voice files a lot smaller that on the previous models and all the new voices sound like crap and there's no way to copy the voices from other devices like you use to with the previous models .\\n If you input an address on where you want to go, it tells you how to get there in very clear graphics and also with a computer voice that is not obnoxious to listen to .\\nI'm really glad I bought it though, and like the easy to read graphics, the voice used to tell you the name of the street you are to turn on, the uncannily accurate estimates of mileage and time of arrival at your destination .\\n Map is bright and detailed, voice directions are clear and loud  .\\nThe voice prompts  are mostly clear, sometimes quirky and the volume levels adequate .\\n The voice system gave ample time to make turns and lane changes .\\n Several voice options will announce both directions and street names, etc .\\n From reviews, I thought there might only be one voice .\\n The pre, installed english voice is a little robotic but if you switch to the british american it is perfect .\\n After ample research   I selected the Nuvi 255W for it's abundant features, wider screen and voice communication .\\nVOICE ACTIVATION DID STOP WORKING & THEN CAME BACK IN GERMAN ,  JUST CHANGED IT BACK ENGLISH & HAS BEEN WORKING WELL SINCE THEN .\\n Love that you can change the voice person talking on this one, my last one didn't do that .\\nOthers have said that the voice directions leave something to be desired in terms of volume and clarity .\\n I must say, though, that I believed it would have a certain cachet to use the British English female voice that is a standard feature but found that she could not properly pronounce some of the street names in my area .\\nThe voice commands are excellent and timely .\\n The model 255W that we received seemed to take longer to find a satelite, and the man's voice was very fast and not as clear, and at times seemed a bit confused in directions .\\n The voice is very clear and gives plenty of warning when we need to make a turn ahead .\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"cluster_label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\":

a room away from the road\\ngood location, close to fishermans wharf, pier 39, ghiradaelli square and cable car stops to union square .\\n And the location is perfect for tourists .\\nAlthough there

from the cable car terminal and adjoined by a large Barnes and Noble bookstore with Starbucks for whiling away any spare moments !\\nThe room had a few annoying decorative items , ,  like a four, foot

and courteous, the rooms are clean, the morning coffee and biscotti are a nice touch, the happy hour is a PLUS, and the price is right  !\\nI planned a weekend getaway and thought because of the

.\\n Nice, medium sized hotel in a good location .\\nThis hotel is in a great location in terms of a walking distance to key Fisherman's Wharf attractions .\\nThe location is excellent right in the centre of fishermans wharf, a few minutes walk to all the major attractions and cable car .\\n The staff at check, in were nice enough, but unfortunately the concierge was not very helpful, giving us

  \"All in all, a normal chain hotel on a nice location  , I will be back if I do not find anthing closer to Picadilly for a better price .\\nGreat Price Terrific Location .\\nOur main focus before booking was looking for a low price with good location .\\n All for the bargain price off \\u00a3 250 for 2 nights including return rail to North Wales .\\nExplore the area and you will find plenty of pubs where you can eat for a reasonable price .\\n Half expected a noisy room by the elevator for the bargain price we paid, but instead got a 17th floor room with awesome city view .\\n The price we paid for our rooms was reasonable .\\nI got this hotel on price line for a 4 night stay with my boyfriend for our anniversary, for about \\u00a380 a night inc taxes, however after reading reviews about this hotel I was very worried about staying here .\\n Breakfast is ok, but not worth paying for if it's not included in your room price .\\n If you're looking for a clean place to rest your head at a decent price and want flexibility to check in or out as you please, this is a good place for you .\\nAll in all, it was a decent hotel, but I think I may try somewhere else next time purely just to see what else is available at the same kind of price .\\n We ate breakfast at the hotel a couple of days and thought it was overprice for the quality of food .\\n For the price and location, this was a very great hotel .\\n Price was unbeatable, just 79 pounds night .\\n We got this for $75 a night, which is a lot cheaper than any listed price we could find .\\nOur breakfasts and one dinner meal were included in our price .\\n One day late and I paid the same price for a better room in HI Kensington, the supposedly better classed HI nearby   .\\n If you need a hotel with services like access to a computer or a concierge who can do more than give directions and order full price tickets to events then don't stay here .\\n\\\\the staff is very friendlyi had found a really nice price and for this money this hotel was incredible .\\n For the price and the location I thought this place was great .\\n Good pub nearby   with wonderful breakfasts and meals at a good price .\\n As previous reviewers have said, there's a variety of shops nearby   and breakfast of a better quality and price can be bought there .\\n and fully intend to come back again ,  if the price is right .\\nI booked this one as none of my favourites were available and I was amazed at the lowish price offered .\\nVery happy with the hotel for the price .\\n Overall for the price I think it was extremely good value .\\nThe biggest disappointment was the price of Internet .\\n However, if you are looking for a comprehensive hotel experience, I'm sure there are plenty of better hotels available for the same price in the city .\\n But there are much better hotels to choose from for the same price and at least you get some good service and respect from staff .\\nGreat Hotel for a great price .\\nI used priceline' name your own price and my bid of a $100 night was exepted for a Sunday and a Monday night .\\nGood hotel for the price nice location .\\n It's nicer than certain other hotels you'd get in the same price range on Priceline and all in all was nice .\\n I wouldn't say it stands out particularly, but if you're looking for a reliable, convenient, comfortable place in London, this is a great place to stay , ,  especially if you can get it at a good price on Priceline or another site like that .\\n Nothing that spectacular to justify the price .\\nIt's an okay hotel, and I don't mind staying there again if I get it for a cheap price through Priceline .\\nRestaurant ,  make sure to try Thai and Singapore restaurants ,  delicious and good price .\\n But again, the location could justify charging that price .\\n Thought that we would be looked after given its rating and the price paid .\\n The price was exceptional for the Kensington area, and as many reviewers have mentioned, it is a two or three minute walk to the Gloucester tube station .\\n All, in, all this hotel was a great choice for the price and location .\\nI booked this hotel via Holiday inn ,2 nights for the price off 1  .\\nGood price   location but no thrills .\\n Got decent price on Hotwire as well .\\n Overall, for the price  , it is a pretty good deal .\\n Good price through ExpediaHotel in general is in good shapeTips :\\n I would not stay at this Holiday Inn again unless the price was halved, because there are simply too many places offering better value in London .\\n Breakfast was appalling, plenty of it, you certainly won\\u0092t starve, but the quality was awful considering the price paid .\\n I was shown an executive room if i wanted to upgrade, for the price of 35 pounds a night .\\nAll in all a pleasant stay for a good price .\\n Although the menu is limited it was very good and a reasonable price .\\n In particular, there was a nice Indian run coffee breakfast restaurant across the street from the tube stop on Gloucester Road that served a good English breakfast at a decent price .\\n Would definitely recommend this hotel if only for the fair price I got on priceline combined with the great, convenient location, which made it easy to get to all the touristy sites in London .\\n Staff very friendly and I always worry when booking through priceline that I will get the worst rooms because the price was so good but got a great room on the 16th floor facing the London Eye .\\n Just make sure you eat as much as you can for the price you have paid .\\n I would recommendeating out as the evening food is frozen re, heat type and for the price you are paying it is not simply worth it .\\n However, the first price that they charged me was too much so I had to get a refund then be charged the correct amount for a standard room .\\n ,  smallish roomsOld style bar pubNo ventilation on a smoking floorIt's not worth the hotel web, site price of \\u00a3160 for STD room .\\nIn short it's a good hotel if you get the price off lastminute .\\ncom   and not the hotel web, site price of \\u00a3160 .\\nWe've stayed in London a lot and booked this hotel for one night due to a number of factors ,  the location, the price   the availibility of a room to accomodate three adults .\\nAnother word of warning when booking through the Holiday Inn website ,  VAT was NOT included in the price at the time of booking until you actually processed the booking and paid for the room ,  this is apparently now normal for many London hotels which I'd never experienced before ,  we ended up paying \\u00a317 more per night than I'd expected .\\nDespite the above problems I would recommend a stay here, price dependant .\\nBought the room for about 1 2 price using Hotwire .\\n Don't buy the bottled water from the hotel ,  go to the supermarket and get it for half the price !\\n However, a continental breakfast was included in the price and had a fairly large selection .\\n We could not have been happier with the location or the room for the price .\\n The bathroom is tiny but at least there is a bathroom attached to the room  in a lot of hotels that I looked at online in the same price range, bathrooms were not en suite .\\n I would stay here again if the price was right .\\nthe only reason to choose this hotel is its location, for other aspects, not up to standard for its price .\\n In sum, we wouldn't pay rack rate for this hotel, but at a reduced price it's an efficient, functional place to stay in London .\\n I would not pay rack rate for a room here, but it is quite attractive at a discounted price .\\n00 which is an affordable price for a hotel in the posh area of Kensington .\\n Hotel was clean, convenient to tubes, internet cafes, and local dining of all price ranges and styles .\\n Also got a good price for the room thro priceline about 47 pounds per night, hotel very clean and well run .\\nAll in all I would recommend and would stay again if the price was right !\\n I had prepaid for the room on Hotwire good price at $120 .\\n If you are just looking for basic lodging at a good price in London,  this is the place .\\n Although in some ways I would have preferred a smaller, more authentic English hotel, we really couldn't beat the combination of price and location   .\\n If you're from the US, think 2, 3X the average price when you convert to US dollars .\\nWould recommend the Holiday Inn Kensington Forum for location, price  , and cleanliness .\\n Location is great, hotel is wonderful, and price is right, it really is hard to beat right now .\\nOur amazing deal from priceline did not include breakfast, but there were many places in the neighborhood to grab breakfast for a reasonable price before heading out for the day .\\nStayed between Xmas and New Years and the room, location, etc were what to expect for the price I paid .\\n My friend and I had one pancakes and syrup, two orange juices, one tea, and one smoked salmon and scrambled egg with english muffin for \\u00a38   in total ,  the same price as one discounted breakfast at the hotel !\\n So often I have booked a hotel at a price only to be disappointed with my choice on arrival .\\n hotel but would stay again if the price was right due to the excellent location .\\n The bags were located in the closet, but no price list .\\n I could have bought a new pair of jeans for that price .\\nAll in all it was just what we expected based on the price and would stay here again .\\nStay here ,  you won't regret it,  great price ,  great location .\\n The shower pressure was a bit low but that's the price you pay for the top floor and it was well worth it  ,  Instead of minibar there was an empty fridge which came quite handy for our own beverages, I doubt they would have milk in their minibar  ,  Tea and coffee making facilites and iron with board were a great bonus to what we had expected from our room .\\n  The only downsize of this hotel I see in the cost of breakfast, with price of more than \\u00a315 for full English breakfast or \\u00a310 if booked in advance .\\nOur Hotwire price did not include breakfast, but several restaurants were nearby, and the hotel had a reasonable coffee crossaint deal .\\n Reserved this hotel through Hotwire and got a price of $90 night .\\n That's a good price even though the room was tiny, however, when it came to the continental breakfast, the hotel would not permit us to partake of same, telling us that because we reserved through Hotwire, we were ineligible for the breakfast .\\nGood if you don't pay retail price .\\nOverall, this hotel is okay if you're on a budget or get a good deal through a discount site, but definitely NOT worth paying retail price for .\\n good hotel for the price and location .\\n Great location and can't beat the price and the comfort !\\nGood Price Great Location Would definately stay there again !\\n Anyway it may not have the charm or history of other hotels in London, but for the price location we would   visit again .\\n We didn't eat at the hotel ,  there were some great cafe's just around the block with great food at a much better price .\\n I would definately recommed this hotel to anyone as it is unbeatable for price and location in London .\\n It was a bargain price for the hotel and it was great  .\\nFor a similarly good location  , you can stay at the London Hilton Metropole for the same price and receive much better service .\\n The room was small, the beds were hard, but a great value for the price we paid .\\n GREAT location and bargain internet price !\\n There is little difference in the price and when we return to London in three weeks I have booked the Millennium in preference to the Forum .\\n Although this was about the same price as the local bars etc .\\nAll in all I would definitly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a pleasant stay in London, in a nice area, at a good price !\\nWe have just stayed in the Kensington Forum and have to say that it is the best hotel we have stayed in in London for the price .\\nOur one night stay was arranged by the cruise line so I can't comment on the price .\\n A very good value for the price .\\n Overall an above average hotel based on location and price   but not one for a romantic get, away !\\nGot this at a great price via priceline and at first was worried about Holiday Inn,  as usually don't care too much for this chain in the U .\\n Considering the horrible exchange rate GBP USD at the time we were in London, I believe the price was fair .\\n I\\u0092m pretty sure the driver took the most direct route from the hotel, so not sure why the difference in price .\\nWe stayed 5 nights in a room whose price was second lowest .\\nExcellent location service cleanliness and price at the Holiday Inn Kensington Forum .\\n Even though this price doesn't include breakfast it was still a great value .\\n The Kensington Forum is about as close to an American style hotel as one can reasonably hope to find in London at a reasonable price .\\n The continental breakfast which was included in the price was very nice and served in the dining room, a pleasant time before dashing off around the city .\\n You could not beat the location or the price .\\n The price is moderate for the service and the location .\\n The price was a real bargain as the published price at the hotel was 210 pounds  !\\n The quality was very good and the price was reasonable .\\nExcellent hotel excellent price .\\n Can't beat the price of $75 per night through Priceline .\\n One of the better places I've stayed in London for the price .\\n Hard to find better at this price .\\n00 Pounds, hotel guests get it at the amazing price of 15 .\\n For that price you get a glass of champagne, half a lobster and a wonderful hot and cold buffet .\\nPrice and location can't be beat .\\n The price for triple cost me 76 pounds at the height of the tourist season .\\n The price was right, and we were even told by an English tour guide that we had gotten a very good deal .\\n Continental breakfast was included in the price of our room package that we purchased through Northwest Airlines, but the breakfast room on the second floor was a bit of a feeding trough .\\nBest location and unbeatable price !\\n We had terrific price per room and seems hard to beat .\\n There is a great supermarket and some restaurants pubs ,  we ate one night at  Ask , which is a small chain of reasonable price .\\n This is definitely a modern hotel, no English charm here, but the location and the price can't be beat .\\nAfter initial angst of getting a room, after a NY, London flight, I settled for a twin and not a double bedded room, 17th floor , small but very comfortable room, windows do open, bathroom new , staff fine and concierge area knowledgeable and openly interested and helpful, the hotel really tries, dont nit pick small things, dont pay more than $120 max and if you want to at least check out other reliable hotels, there are many shockers at all price ranges, do your research  !\\nGreat room fabulous price wonderful location !\\n\",\n          \" The room was packed to capacity with queues at the food buffets .\\n The over zealous   staff cleared our unfinished drinks while we were collecting cooked food and movement around the room with plates was difficult in the crowded circumstances .\\n There are a couple pubs, a great patisserie and even fast food restaurants within a block .\\nThe neighborhood is an upscale residential area full of restaurants in easy walking distance ranging from  fast food  to up, scale with a wide variety of cuisines , ,  we never had a bad meal .\\nThe food   was wonderful, a selection of sandwiches, salads, cous cous and spicy wedge potato's, fruit salad and a cake was a good fill up when needed .\\nFull English breakfast was included in our rate and was very good indeed ,  staff were busy clearing tables promptly and fresh food kept arriving all the time .\\n One local restaurant stood out for having excellent food,  Olives  located one block away .\\n,  Great location  ,  Very good selection of food for breakfast buffet .\\n I can't see what sets it apart from other 3, star hotels I've stayed in ,  other than the fact it's in London, in a posh area and has good food .\\n We ate breakfast at the hotel a couple of days and thought it was overprice for the quality of food .\\n There are plenty of restaurants in the area as well, including fast food joints and two small, ish supermarkets .\\n They also have a great room service menu and was surprised at the big portions and quality of the food, great to get a bit in your room after a night on the town .\\n Breakfast equally tired ,  although a reasonable selection of food, general ambience in restaurant more like a youth hostel .\\n The breakfast buffet full English breakfast was fantastic with a very good selection of food .\\nreally nice hotel for buissnessnot much around in terms of shoppin etcfood was ok\\nEverything about this hotel was first class including the food !\\n The nicest surprise was how fantastic the food was which I hadn't expected in a large chain hotel .\\n It is very convenient to the Gloucester Road tube stop, grocery store, drug store and fast food places .\\n I ordered room service one night, and the food was delightful, and the service was fast and friendly .\\n The location is just around the corner from the tube, Boots and Waitrose   right next door, close to many restaurants including fast food if you like .\\n Talking about food, something worth noticing is that there was a fridge in the room, but it was completely reserved for the mini, bar service beverages, which completely filled it .\\n There was a massive queue for the restaurant, the food was beginning to run low we went down at 9 .\\n There were Italian, Indian, British, American fast food, and Thai restaurants very close to the hotel on Cromwell   Gloucester Rds .\\nRoom service is expensive but good, the food was delivered hot and was tasty but was chosen from the current uninspired Holiday Inn room service menu, when I ordered a \\u00a36 .\\n   You could buy food from Sainsburys or Waitrose which were 2 minutes away to save money .\\n Food Drink a little pricey in local establishments .\\n95 if you want hot food as well .\\n Note that all around the hotel are decent little cafes and shops to get either full breakfasts or breakfast foods .\\n We ate on evening once at the Garfunkels pub in the mall, it was typical chain restaurant food but fast with good service .\\n There was an adequate self service buffet, not a huge selection or very well presented, cloths were not changed when food got spilt .\\n Not exactly what most tourists are looking for but when you have been out of the states as long as we have you eat fast food when you get the chance !\\n There is no mini, fridge in standard rooms, so you can't store any food ,  the hotel used to have mini, fridges .\\n Poor customer service, bad and overpriced pub food .\\nThere is a grocery store close by that you can pick up food and a Starbucks nearby .\\n As mentioned, there are several places to buy food if you're going cheap :\\nThe hotel is just a couple of minutes walk from the nearest tube station and also has a Waitrose , Tesco and various Fast Food joints and restaurants nearby .\\n Shame that we had to use the forum restaurant this morning prior to check out ,  this restaurant is on the first floor and is one of the buffet style breakfasts so lukewarm food and very busy .\\nThe food is very, very good   and the staff were very friendly .\\n The hotel itself was very pleasant ,  the staff friendly and helpful and I can only comment on the breakfasts as this was the only meal that we had there ,  the food was excellent with a wide variety of choice .\\n The food was excellent, the service was very friendly and the prices cheap .\\n The food is excellent and the service great .\\n The bar food actually looked pretty inviting as it passed by .\\n If you like Indian food we ate at the Dehli Brassiere it was exellent and more reasonably priced .\\n I would recommendeating out as the evening food is frozen re, heat type and for the price you are paying it is not simply worth it .\\n You can buy drinks and breakfast food at a Waitrose supermarket and Tesso express mart next door .\\n The area has a few pubs, a couple of steak places, a number of Indian restaurants and some fast food, so it's convenient for that .\\n Within 200 yards of leaving the hotel and heading to the Tube Station   you have a number of fast food outlets, highstreet Restautants, Pastry shops and supermarkets, so if you did wish to live in your hotel room for the duration of your stay, you could do !\\n as for the continental breakfast taste was good but became boring after the 3rd day the food served wasnt changed .\\nWe ate in the bistro downstairs and the food was very good ,  although the portions varied significantly depending on the chef that night .\\n The buffet breakfast is ok although not the best I've had and usually includes a selection of fresh fruit as well as the usual 'full english' The food in the ground floor restaurant is good  I haven't had problems with room service although the menu has recently changed and doesn't have as good a selection as it did .\\n When the food arrive   it was the wrong order .\\n I can also tell you that there is nothing fantastic about the food .\\n While travelling out of London to any of the popular destinations, food can be pretty expensive .\\n The rooms have never disappointed and the food is always nice .\\n Breakfast was OK, great choice, but the cooked food was a bit tepid .\\n The area is really safe with great food, boots, tesco, waitrose   burger king, kfc and starbucks .\\nAdditionally, they recommended the Cafe Forum which was about two blocks from the hotel for breakfast, the prices were reasonable and food was excellent .\\n00, good quality food, lots of choice, continental, full english, hot and fresh, very friendly staffs .\\n There is 24 hour room service, a restaurant, and a tavern in the hotel although we did not sample the hotel food .\\n Many hotels I have stayed in the food has been rarely hot .\\n The bed was very comfortable, and the empty refrigerator was a great place to store food and beverages .\\n Within easy reach you have all you could want peaceful areas and shops and food outlets .\\n I can't comment on any of the hotel restaurants or food as we never ate there with so many other choices nearby .\\n Avoid the food in the hotel restaurant as it is ridiculously overpriced .\\n Also there is a nice bistro around the corner with very good food that is moderately priced .\\nThe food here is great, we had breakfast brought to our room, although pricy well worth it .\\n Minimall with Boots pharmacy, Whole Foods type ritzy fullservice market, coffee shops, etc .\\nWould not recommend the Patisserie food looked overpriced, pastries were dry !\\n Food is overpriced everywhere due to $ to pound conversion of course .\\nthere are a variety of priced places to eat in the immediate area, but the food costs are always high,  we ate mostly at pubs, where the beer and scotch were very reasonably priced always !\\n More than enough food choices with coffee or tea, juice, pastries, toast, yogurt, cereal and assorted cold cuts to please every taste .\\n Another good thing is that the rooms have mini, fridges and it's great for storing ready, to, eat food from Waitrose .\\n they mark down their food at the end of the day and you can get great deals on everything from sandwhiches to desserts at a fraction of the cost .\\nThe food in the restaurant is terrible .\\n Both of these offer good variety of good food at very reasonable prices and suitable for children .\\n The Glouster Road tube station is just two minutes away, along with other food stores, pubs, internet cafes, restaurants etc .\\n Its a chain but the food was cheap and delicious !\\n Stunning food, amazing service .\\n We didn't eat at the hotel ,  there were some great cafe's just around the block with great food at a much better price .\\n If you're a family vacation traveller, you'll probably make use of the grocery store often becuse food in London is expensive when you consider the terrible USD, GPB exchange rate .\\n Many restaurants in the neighborhood, ranging from swanky to fast food to haute cuisine .\\n There are coffee and pastry shops around the corner and fast food .\\n There is also a grocery store in a shopping plaza on the corner where you can buy take out food, wine, etc .\\n It was in a fantastic position, one block to the Gloucester Road tube station    there's a supermarket and fast food shops, as well as other shops nearby and opposite the station .\\n But it's great value for money, great location, pleasant staff, good food, and we'll be staying there again .\\n Food was OK, service very haphazard .\\n The range of food available would have satirfied anyone, all well cooked and efficiently replenished .\\nI didn't sample any of the food options but there are several outlets just around the hotel .\\nThe huge coffe bar in the lobby is quite nice and offers drinks and food at good prices .\\n The Delhi Brasserie restaurant recommended by the hotel's concierge was a short walk, the food delicious and reasonable .\\n The food was good and the service was very good .\\n Additionally, there are numerous restaurants everywhere ranging from fast food to upscale .\\n There was also a more expensive English breakfast with many hot foods which was included in some room prices .\\n The frig doesn\\u0092t keep items cold enough for food safety \\u0096 it\\u0092s merely to slightly chill .\\nThe Waitrose Market sells yummy food .\\nI want close proximity to tube station, starbucks, and food .\\n Food was expensive, but that is true all over London just now .\\n The Waitrose supermarket has many take out food options .\\nAnother reviewer mentioned the smell of food on the 25th floor .\\n Very convenient, but don't stay on that floor as the smell of heating food wafts down the corridor .\\n The best food deal in this area is the local grocery store down the street ,  get your breakfast and lunch here and dine out nightly .\\n One block from the tube, half a block from a nice grocery store for essentials like bottled water, snacks and takeaway prepared food, tissues, etc .\\n Food quality was good, service prompt, everything prepared as we had ordered .\\nThe food in their pub as far as sandwiches etc, was reasonable .\\n Food in Pub is excellent value .\\n All the 4 nights we stayed there we relished the hot Indian food takeout from the WaitRose grocery chain, which is just around the corner .\\n Really good Indian food is just a few blocks away .\\nThere is an Internet cafe, laundramat and Sainsbury grocery store to the left up Cromwell Road and fast food, Banks   and post offices to the right down Cromwell road .\\n It is in a nice neighborhood with fast food, resturants, and shopping with in walking distance .\\n because it has sensor to count how many times you open it for beverage service, nice area, near Starbucks, pastry shops, fast foods, supermarket, walking distances to Kensington Palace, London Natural Science Museum, Harrods, Victoria Albert Musuem, pubs, and what else could you ask for .\\n The food was delicious in both the Consortia and Forum restaurants in the hotel .\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n

accurate directions, whereever we intend to go .\\n This function is not accurate if you don't leave it in battery mode say, when you stop at the Cracker Barrell for lunch and to play one of those trangle games with the tees .\\n It provides immediate alternatives if the route from the online map program was inaccurate or blocked by an obstacle .\\n I've used other GPS units, as well as GPS built into cars   and to this day NOTHING beats the accuracy of a Garmin GPS .\\n It got me from point A to point B with 100% accuracy everytime .\\n It has yet to disappoint, getting me everywhere with 100% accuracy .\\n0 out of 5 stars Honest, accurate review, , PLEASE READ !\\n Aside from that, every destination I've thrown at has been 100% accurate .\\nIn closing, this is a fantastic GPS with some very nice features and is very accurate in directions .\\n Plus, I've always heard that there are  quirks  with any GPS being accurate, having POIs, etc .\\n DESTINATION TIME, , This is pretty accurate too .\\n But, it's always very accurate .\\n The map is pretty accurate and the Point of interest database also is good .\\n Most of the times, this info was very accurate .\\nI've even used it in the  pedestrian  mode, and it's amazing how accurate it is .\\n  ONLY  is only accurate when an ad says,  Top sirloin steak, ONLY $1 .\\n The most accurate review stated that these machines are adjunct to a good map and signs on the interstate .\\n The directions are highly accurate down to a  T  .\\n Depending on what you are using it for, it is a nice adjunct to a travel trip and the directions are accurate and usually the quickest, but not always .\\n The screen is easy to see, the voice tells you where you are and it's very accurate .\\n It was accurate to the minute when it told me when I would arrive home .\\n0 out of 5 stars GPS Navigator doesn't navigate accurately on a straight road .\\n I was familiar with the streets and only used the Nuvi to get an accurate arrival time estimate .\\n but after that it is very easy and quite accurate to use .\\n The accuracy at this point is very good .\\nWhile the 255W routing seems generally accurate and logical, on my first use I discovered that it does have some errors in its internal map .\\n Bottom line is I wanted a unit that is accurate and had reliable satellite connection .\\n I've used it around town and find it to be extremely accurate .\\nI found the maps to be inaccurate at first, but after I updated them from Garmin's website everything is golden .\\n A lot of my friends' addresses are inaccurate by any GPS .\\n It loads quickly, have pretty accurate directions, and can recalculate quickly when I miss a turn .\\n Because the accuracy is good to the street address level, it may not be able to guide you to the exact location if your destination is inside a shopping mall .\\nI updated to the latest 2010 map soon after I received the unit, so the map is accurate to me .\\n I was blown away at the accuracy and routing capability this thing had .\\n I used it the day I bought it,   and then this morning, and as soon as it comes on it is  ready to navigate  The only downfall of this product, and the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is the fact that the speed limit it displays for the road you are on isn't 100% accurate .\\n If your looking for a nice, accurate GPS for not so much money, got with this one .\\n0 out of 5 stars Inexpensive, accurate, plenty of features, August 6, 2009\\n The only glitch I have found so far is that the speed limits are not 100% accurate, although the GPS, amazingly, is able to very accurately tell you how fast your vehicle is moving .\\n I was a little disappointed in the inaccuracy of the posted speed limit, as I'm guilty of not paying close enough attention to those signs, especially w  interstate speed traps that are constantly changing up and down .\\n The closest one that gives the most accurate route that I usually take is the Navigon .\\n After 2 weeks, it has yet to make a mistake, and is always completely accurate ,  even to the point of telling me which side of the street my destination is on .\\n It has worked well for local driving giving accurate directions for roads and streets .\\nThe estimated time to arrival does not seem to calculate the travelling time accurately .\\nAccuracy is as good as any other unit, they all sometimes tell you you have arrived when you haven't, or continue to tell you to turn when you're already there .\\n Accuracy is determined by the maps .\\n Less traveled rural roads will not be accurate on any unit .\\n Accuracy is within a few yards .\\nWhat the 255w does best is find a street address, business, point of interest, hospital or airport and give you turn, by, turn directions with amazing accuracy .\\n The Garmin is loaded with very accurate maps that generally know the roads in even the remotest areas .\\nI'm really glad I bought it though, and like the easy to read graphics, the voice used to tell you the name of the street you are to turn on, the uncannily accurate estimates of mileage and time of arrival at your destination .\\nMy new Garmin 255w had very Easy Set Up, Accurate Directions to locations, User Friendly Unit to anyone in my vehicle who tried it .\\n I had a GPS 10, years ago when I owned a boat that was difficult to use and with very poor accuracy so I had assumed that the road GPS wasn't any better .\\n Practiced visiting places I already knew to see how accurate the directions and maps would be .\\n Easy to use, excellent accuracy, nice and intuitive interface .\\n The directions provided have all been quite accurate thus far .\\n,  Very Accurate but with one small glitch I found ,  I'll explain in the CONS\\nThis is a great GPS, it is so easy to use and it is always accurate .\\nVery easy to operate and pretty accurate as well, only led me astray once and that was in northern Maine where roads are few and paved ones fewer .\\n Easy to use and amazed at how accurate this item is .\\nTo date it's been a very easy to use and accurate .\\n Mounted really easily and has been very accurate .\\n seems to be rather accurate .\\n It was accurate on determing original directions and recalculating when necessary .\\nHighly accurate, POIs are great .\\n I can't believe how accurate and detailed the information estimated time of arrival,speed limits along the way,and detailed map of my route, to name a few .\\n Speed of calculation, accuracy, and simplicity of operation are top notch .\\n\",\n          \"I thought it would be fitting to christen my Kindle with the Stephen King novella UR, so went to the Amazon site on my computer and clicked on the button to buy it .\\n As soon as I'd clicked the button to confirm my order it appeared on my Kindle almost immediately !\\nAfter reading through the introductory guide that loads up automatically at the start and following along it took me almost no time to learn which buttons are where and what each of them do .\\n I started reading with the default size without my glasses and noticed I was squinting a bit, so changed to one size larger with a couple button clicks and it was much easier without feeling like the print was too big and took up too much of the page .\\n The gadget feeling is underlined by needing to press a button to turn pages .\\nIt took very little time to get used to having to push a button to turn pages and the screen flash as they turn only really startled me the first few times .\\n I don't feel the need to push the button ahead of time to prepare for the end of the page at all, which evidently a lot of Kindle 1 owners do since it's a bit more sluggish .\\n unintended page changes, the awkward way I sometimes have to hold it to keep from hitting buttons, the sometimes slow page refresh, and the screen freezes that now has me traveling with a paper clip lest I need to do a reset while commuting on the train .\\n No longer do I have to press and hold two buttons to put the device to sleep .\\n the button hinges are on the outside ,  at the edge ,  of the K2 .\\n You need to press on the interior of the button to get it to click .\\n Combine that with the smaller button sizes and one major source of frustration has been instantly eliminated !\\n The little power button at the top of the Kindle is really a power slide .\\n The change in the hinging and size of the buttons is major plus and would make it hard to go back to the K1 .\\n sleeker look and feel  , sharper screen, no longer accidentally depressing the next page button by accident and having to find your place in the book again .\\n,  The 5, way button, though a bit small, allows you to select left and right, and not just up and down like the original version .\\n Only issue is I need to recalibrate now, , in general, I try to anticipate how much time it will take the next page to load, and when I'm two lines from the bottom, I would hit the next page button .\\n Now I need to push the button later .\\n That 5, way button is magical .\\nThe main issue I had with Kindle 1 was the navigation button design and placement .\\n I like to read holding the Kindle with one hand and it just didn't work well because I kept bumping the next, previous and back buttons .\\n The display is better and the 5, way button is a major improvement .\\n On off buttons are repositioned to be easily accessible .\\n Things like the buttons that made it easy to accidentally turn pages  the separate cursor on the side that could only select lines and was sometimes hard to see  the occasionally awkward menus  the case which practically forced you to remove it to use it and sometimes pulled the battery door off .\\n The second thing is the buttons .\\n This means that when you handle the Kindle 2 by the edges, the pages don't change even if you grab by the buttons .\\n Yet changing pages is effortless when you do ,  the buttons are right between your thumbs and the slightest pressure on their faces is enough to activate them .\\n That it doesn't have the quirky, clunky, annoying buttons that filled \\u00be of each side of its predecessor, buttons that caused dozens upon dozens of accidental page turns makes it that much sexier .\\nWhat I like most about the Kindle 2 is the placement of the buttons and their inversion .\\n It has the feel of the mouse button in the middle of a laptop keyboard and I never liked those .\\n Manipulating that button reminded me of something I'd rather not think about when trying to get work done .\\n if you don't upgrade, you will regret it every time you accidentally hit one of the obscenely large buttons and advance or retreat one, two, three, or even four pages .\\n The page turn buttons are better .\\n With the Kindle 1, I was constantly at risk of accidentally bumping the next page buttons .\\n With the Kindle 2, the buttons have been scaled down to a much more manageable size and are a lot less sensitive .\\n I love the 4, way directional button .\\n It took a little getting used to after having used the Kindle 1, especially since the context menus that I was used to in the first gen have changed due to the new directional button, but for any Kindle user, this change is a god send .\\n It looks good, feels good in the hand, has good buttons, which are easy to operate on purpose but not so easy accidentally .\\n A button click brings up the dictionary, starting with that entry .\\nIt's very easy to page forward or backward through the text with the dedicated buttons .\\n The button layout looks odd because it's so regularly spaced in rows versus the keyboard's staggered style, but it isn't any harder to use than a cellphone's tri, letter entry or blackberry keyboard .\\n The buttons are not hard to press at all .\\n Every K2 button has a satisfying \\n Just like how I prefer to grasp the page a few sentences before the end of a page, I tend to press the  Next Page  button a bit sooner than I finish reading the page .\\n The lag actually helps in that respect, and even so, the lag between pushing the button and the new page appearing is much faster than I could ever physically flip any book page without shearing it from the spine .\\n,  Inside, edge buttons ,  These have saved me from accidentally pressing buttons many times .\\n The text is darker and clearer and the buttons are more like the Sony , ,  both on one side   .\\n when I received my Kindle 2 I was very impressed with the design, especially the improved button design .\\nTiny buttons with even tinier text on the buttons .\\nThe incredibly tiny buttons are literally impossible for people with low, vision to read .\\n And the tiny buttons with the even tinier text ?\\nGreatly improved page turning buttons .\\n The codes vary depending on which button I press and the most recent code has been 90UGC .\\nEach time this has happened, I have contacted the support team, each time the team member has made me delete the book from the device,they've resent it to me and I've had to do the hold the power button for 20 seconds process each time .\\nI'm not crazy about the way that the scroll button works either .\\n The buttons and the controller work smoothly .\\n Sleek style, easy to hold, the white causes it to disappear as suggested in its description, highly transportable, well thought out button placement, easy to use, adjustable font, ease of downloading new books .\\n I love how the content manager is better integrated and I don't have to hit so many buttons to manage my books .\\nWhat I hate ,  I hate the new button positioning .\\n Since the K2 is longer and the buttons are near the bottom, its awkward to hold and feels unbalanced in my hands, almost like it will tip over .\\n When I'm trying to go to the next page, I hit the home button by accident a lot .\\n I also hate the fact that you really have to push the buttons hard to change the page .\\n I really liked the extra responsiveness of the K1 buttons   .\\n However I was disappointed to discover that I was unable to press the buttons from that position .\\n With the K2 I can turn on the TTS feature with one button, place it beside me, and have it read to me all night !\\nI contemplated changes to my beloved Kindle with dread, I was one of the few who loved the old page, turning buttons .\\n I worried that the new buttons would be Sony Reader size, and impossible for me to press .\\n Thankfully the buttons are still at least thumb, size, and may appear hard to press, until you realize that they are hinged on the inside .\\n I like the new size and feel of the buttons .\\n It is much harder now to accidentally hit the page buttons .\\n But holding the darn thing was a chore without pressing that next button page .\\n Kind of hard to do when you're inadvertently pressing buttons .\\n Also the keyboard has been redesigned to make things easier as well as added buttons like  menu  which is nice .\\n I find myself using a large size typeface to compensate for the lack of contrast, but this means frequent  next page  button presses which is extremely annoying .\\n The buttons have a cheap feel .\\n The  next page  buttons should activate when pressed at any angle .\\n Upgrade the quality of the hardware especially the buttons .\\n You can pretty much figure everything out by just trying the buttons .\\nThe next, previous, back buttons are much smaller and are hard to hit accidentally .\\nThe keyboard buttons are small, round, low, profile and have slightly convex tops .\\nThe on, off button is now on top and the radio on, off switch is now in a software menu .\\nThe Kindle 1 roller button and quirky silver navigation bar are gone .\\n My thanks to  Arts&HistoryFan  for pointing out that when you hit the menu button, the time is shown in the top banner .\\n Yes, I noticed some of the initial design flaws in the first, generation Kindle ,  the placement of the  next page  buttons, the general sense of flimsiness ,  but I decided I could live with those .\\n Opened the box, press the button and it begins downloading books that I pre, ordered .\\n The welcome screen comes on to explain all the buttons .\\n One thing I didn't like was the page next button failed to work when the text to speech was in use and I wanted to skip ahead .\\n sym button depressed at same time\\n Buttons are accessible, raised for convenience of all involved ,  another big plus for the visually impaired or those with other conditions .\\n The sound button is raised only slightly ,  fine for VI but potentially problematic for those with arthritis or other issues with fine motor function as it is a relatively thin button that must be pressed slightly .\\nThe buttons are well placed and need a good push to change pages, but not so much that it detracts from your reading .\\nNavigation is much easier with the 5, way button .\\n I miss having a dedicated button to deactivate the wireess, but the overall device has improved so much that I will get over the loss quickly .\\nButtons are not hard to press for me .\\n They do require a bit of pressure, but I like it that way so I can rest my thumbs on the buttons without turning the page accidentally .\\n They seem to be in the perfect location, I can grip the K2 easily and do not have to worry about pressing a button on accident but when I need to change the page they are right where I want them .\\n Moving the cursor to the word in question can be a bit awkward since there is some delay using the 5 direction button, but it's not so awkward as to not use the feature .\\n Getting a free sample wirelessly and then just hitting a button to buy it is great .\\n I hate tiny gadgets with tiny screens covered with tiny buttons that lead to a labyrinth of tiny submenus filled with nonsensical options .\\n Click a button and it's there in seconds .\\n The buttons have been made smaller, which fixed the large buttons on the lst generation that made the device hard to hold and frustratingly easy to advance the page .\\n,  One button to turn on, turn off, and sleep .\\n I also like the fact the button is on the top and not on the back as it was on the K1 .\\n I just have to use the new five way button to highlight the word and look up shows at the bottom without leaving the page .\\nsignificant improvement over Kindle 1's non intuitive forward and previous buttons .\\n Also I'm afraid that overusing the mouse button may cause it to wear out quickly .\\n If you wish to go back say a dozen pages to look up something you simply have to press the 'previous page' button 12 times in succession .\\n Again navigation is by using the next and previous page buttons .\\n My mother, in, law has enough difficulty with her fingers and the tiny buttons that she generally uses a pencil, eraser to push the buttons .\\n When you look at it, if you don't focus too hard, the little buttons and controls fade away and all you see is the text .\\n The only thing you can do is rotate, which makes some PDFs readable but then you're in the awkward position of having to press the next and previous page buttons vertically instead of horizontally .\\n One day while laying on the couch reading I pressed the 'next page' button and the screen went blank .\\n While not as much text fits on a screen as on a mass, market paperback page using the font size I like, pushing the  next page  button has become second nature .\\n My one complaint is that I'd like a  previous page  button on both side of the screen, the way there's a  next page  button on both sides, but that's a very minor consideration .\\n Reading the book in the cover isn't a problem as the front cover readily folds around to the back so that it isn't making the left, edge buttons hard to press .\\n To use the  enter  function, that is to execute a command or enter the text I've typed in, I just have to push downward on the square button .\\nThe prev next back home buttons are too small ?\\n Add a prev page button on the right and a home button on the left .\\nNext page and other buttons ,  very easy to use .\\n The buttons really are much better .\\nI also found using the navigation button difficult .\\n The size and buttons are fine with me .\\n The new navigation button works well, and the keyboard   feels good to my fingers .\\n The buttons are also laid out and I'm so glad they put the  Next  buttons on both sides since it makes it so easy to use .\\n The Qwerty keyboard, while the buttons are small, is spaced nicely for ease of use .\\n I find the Kindle buttons perfect for this type of device .\\nI find the buttons easy to use .\\n,  I find the myriad of buttons on the face of the device to be very nicely done .\\n As highly documented before, the buttons on the side of the device used for page turning, going to the home screen, and accessing the menu all engage with an inward click .\\n This enables you to pick up the device with the edges without pressing any buttons .\\n They buttons are well placed .\\n The page turning buttons are a lot easier to hit than say, flipping a page in a real book while lying in bed, having said page get caught up on the covers, and having to adjust to get it squared away .\\n The major buttons on both sides are for the next page .\\n For some reason, my brain wants a prior page button on the left side and the next page button on the right .\\n I hit the page button once and looked left as though I had turned an actual page in a book .\\nA minor grumble, I keep wanting to press Next Page rather than the select button to make things happen .\\n Its the position of the buttons that seems to make me want to do that .\\n I intuitively want the biggest button to be 'select' rather than Next Page .\\n Your finger can rest on the  next page  button, and a simple click is all you need to advance .\\n When you hold it in the opposite hand, the next page button is on the other side too .\\n I don't need two hands to hold the book open when I'm on the train, or whenever, just one hand gives you good access to all the buttons even while you are holding the device .\\n I also love the fact they made the next and previous page buttons a little bit harder to push so I am not constantly pressing buttons I don't mean to .\\n The buttons work well even with my large fingers and the navigating 5, position control is easily mastered and easy to use effectively .\\n, new buttons are a massive step up .\\n You can hold the buttons on the edge and not turn pages .\\n There is a feeling of strength to the thumb buttons, they are not oversensitive like the old ones, and the keyboard is a great improvement over those odd keys on the K1 .\\nMy only fear is that I will wear out my 5 direction menu button within the month,  since there is SO much to see, do and find\\n Just hit the enter button on the keyboard, and it takes you directly to the full dictionary entry, complete with pronunciation guide .\\n The buttons are placed in a convenient area without being in the way, yet turning a page is a breeze .\\n Previous button presses inward, toward the screen, while other buttons press toward the outside edges .\\n All of the controls and buttons are well placed and easy to understand .\\nThe redesign of the buttons is a great improvement .\\nWhen I purchased the Kindle originally, I had several issues with the physical layout, the inability to stop the  accidental  button pushing and the sharp corners .\\nIn the Kindle 2, the corners have been rounded and the buttons have been restructured so that it takes a little pressure to press inward instead of outward .\\nThe placement of the on off button is much better at the top rather than the back as previously .\\n I really enjoy the menu button and the 5, way controller to navigate .\\n The buttons rubbed the fingers at the bottom .\\n On the Kindle 2, the button has been moved to the top right side of the device .\\nThe keyboard buttons are smaller and also require some pressure to activate .\\n What remains to be seen, however, is whether the Kindle 2 will be plagued with having to be reset as frequently as the Kindle, nor did I see a reset button .\\n I love the  next page  button on both sides of the Kindle 2 .\\n The buttons on the K2 are not easily pressed while reading, and I love the 5, way button that allows me to easily navigate between my newpaper pages   .\\n I flicked the switch to start reading, and the screen froze with a bunch of lines on it that would flicker a bit when I hit a button, but that was all .\\nThere is no 1, 800 number for Canada for Kindle support, so you request them to call you via a button on their site .\\n I hit the button, bent over to plug in the Kindle, and the phone rang before I straightened up .\\n\",\n          \" I had to uninstall anti, virus and selected other programs, some of which did not have listings in the  Programs and Features  Control Panel section .\\n This review briefly touches upon some of the key features and enhancements of Microsoft's latest OS .\\n All of these features combine to create a much improved and enjoyable desktop experience .\\nI enjoyed the new convenience features in Windows 7 .\\n They showed me PC laptops that had more features than the MacBook, and which cost way less than the MacBook, too .\\n But that aside, I like the availability of software, the new features like the improved Taskbar, Windows Peek, and the Aero environment .\\nIf you're used to OS X, but want to come into the PC world where things cost less and you get more features, by all means consider Windows 7 the stepping stone to do just that .\\n After seeing the pricing on the newest MacBooks this week, and the limited features compared to what I currently own, I have to say that now is the right time to consider that switch to PC .\\n These new features make the user experience much more superior than anything Windows has ever offered .\\n Also there are some other new things such as touch gesture features and disk encryption that normal users won't use either because it isn't needed or the hardware isn't widely adopted yet   .\\n You can read all the new features in your Windows 7 short version handbook .\\n But what I really like about Windows 7 are the new and improved features it offers .\\nAlso in Windows Explorer, two new features .\\nAll the nifty new features mean squat if my computers don't function properly .\\n, then Vista, but if so, none of its features have been impressive enough to have blown me away .\\n It does have some nice features .\\n W7 is fast and resource friendly, every hardware device works perfect  , and there's a ton of great features .\\n Runs well, but no stand out new features for my usage .\\nHaving used Windows ME and XP for several years, and before upgrading, Vista, I heard a lot of great things about Windows 7, as well as new features .\\n I liked the built, in features of Vista and of course the appearance, but I prefered the stability and speed of XP even with a high, end system .\\n,  Better user interface features like being able to view the desktop with one mouse gesture to the bottom right of the screen .\\nLEAST useful features of Windows 7 to me :\\n They're features I don't use .\\n Windows 7 Ultimate is there too off course, but I personally can't bring myself to spend that much more money just to get a tiny few features that I know I will never use like multi, language support and BitLocker .\\n It's loaded with useful features .\\n It has some features that I personally don't find useful, BUT if in the future I do need them, they're there .\\n There are many features that allow me to personalize my working environment .\\n   Vista has more features than XP, but many of them didn't make the OS more usable for me .\\n Personally I thought Vista was very handsome, what with its transparency, 3, D effects, color schemes, and usability improvements to Windows Explorer, and I believe Windows 7 continues that trend by looking just as sexy , ,  if not more , ,  while at the same time adding its own valuable features and enhancements .\\n I haven't yet become accustomed to some features like Aero Shake, but hey, those things are there if I need them .\\nI can't tell what positives it offers still, but it's still a nifty upgrade with a lot of nifty features over XP that make for a more fun experience for some, and a more organized experience involving navigating huge catacombs of archives and files .\\n Did I mention that Win7 offers nothing in terms of any new worthwhile features ?\\n0 out of 5 stars XP speed & stability, Vista, like features without the headaches !\\n I really wanted to like Vista with all it's cool new features, but unfortunately it was a disaster because it just didn't work .\\n And I love all the new Aero Shake Peek Snap windows features, but I still prefer Mac OS X's Expose .\\n,  New features with better window and file managment\\n,  Many features are copied from Mac OS X\\n Of course there are some new features, and a little more eye candy if that's important to you too .\\n Nice upgrade and love some of the new features, snip tool, sticky's on the desktop, Docking on the task bar and thanks for clearing the clutter on the Tray .\\n W7 has some cool features that I like, and I'm sure I don't even know the half of it yet .\\n I don't have a TV Tuner, so I can't take advantage of that feature, but there are other features & it seems to be working good .\\n00 dollars just to upgrade for some fancy new features .\\n Since my Google Sidebar had some features that I liked, it allowed me to replace it for the Windows one .\\n Because others on this site have already described in sufficient detail all the amazing features of W7, I will not repeat them .\\n There are so many more features of this that are very difficult to list all here .\\n All   of these features have worked 100% of the time, which is previously unheard of .\\n Removing a  feature  from the Programs and Features panel simply disables access to it, but the underlying program files associated with that feature remain on the hard, drive taking up space .\\n I also noticed improved power management, including once of my favorite features which is the auto dimming of my laptop monitors once my computer is not being used .\\nAll the features of Vista, but without any of the problems .\\n It still works pretty good though, just a lack of some features that i had before .\\n What I will highlight are a few features of Windows 7 which I have been thoroughly impressed with .\\n Perhaps my expectations were low, since Microsoft OSes tend usually to be just functional   without much pizazz or many  power user  shortcuts and features, but Windows 7 really is a well, crafted OS .\\n I do not use most of the features, such as gaming, that seem to benefit most from the upgrade .\\nDoes the new operating system have cool features ?\\n My only complaint would be that I would like to have a family pack available in the Windows Professional flavor or at least the option to purchase some of the professional features separately .\\n Seems like they actually stepped it down when it should have been stepped up with more features .\\n I think the reason it didn't is because it wants to force the user to use the Windows Live toolbar that includes other features similar to what Google offers .\\nSmooth OS with great little features .\\n A lot of the new finder desktop windows features are awkward working versions of what Mac OS X has had for a couple of years or more .\\n If you didn't come over from the bright side you would probably think these features are very cool, so enjoy them for what they are if you've never played around with a Mac enough to be comfortable in that environment .\\n I am not going to review the features, because there's plenty of that already .\\nThere is not a lot of new features in the operating system .\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"cluster_label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\":

each night .\\nThe staff at the desk very rarely welcomed you back from your day out sightseeing etc .\\n I found the concierge and front desk staff to be helpful and the housekeepers to be quite good .\\nThe check in   check out were very efficient, however my personal opinion was that the staff did not go out of their way to be friendly or welcoming .\\n On arrival, were met by friendly reception staff .\\n They have a parking garage, but they make you leave your vehicle for them to park   and then if you want to take a drive later, you have to wait for the staff to get it .\\n The Tuscan staff moved our packed luggage into the new room, and my husband and I discovered that both of our phone chargers were missing .\\n Which is a pitty, because the location was wonderful, and two of the staff members were really nice .\\nUpon entering the elegant lobby we were greeted pleasantly by the staff .\\n Helpful staff and safe surrounds .\\n It has some charms in decor, and all staff gave

what to see and where to eat .\\n The front desk staff was efficent and friendly .\\n I have to say I see everyone that reviews this hotel compliments the front desk staff I actually found from the second day on that they were most unhelpful and actually quite rude !\\n Also on my third day I came back from a long day sightseeing and stopped at the front desk to ask for milk and sugar to be sent up to the room as we wanted to have a coffee after our long day at which I was told to go into the restaurant and ask the waiting staff myself and take it up to my room myself !\\nAll the staff was friendly, though I found the maintanence and housekeeping staff to be the warmest in the building .\\n The staff and service were exceptional .\\nEvery hotel should have this staff !\\nIm actually still in the hotel and couldnt wait to write my review, but from the moment we arrived the staff at this best western could not have done more for us .\\n Every hotel should have the staff that is here at the Best western Tuscan inn .\\n Checkout early Wednesday morning took about 2 minutes to complete, no complaints with the staff .\\n The hotel staff ,  as a whole ,  were more than happy to go above and beyond to satisfy your request .\\n We found the staff very helpful especially Jose .\\n It has a good look, nice sitting area in the lobby, wine hour every night, friendly and helpful

staff at the check in out counter .\\n Also, the staff   Chief Chief Concierge are very friendly   knowledgable .\\n Hotel was comfortable and all the staff helpful and polite .\\n Jorge was extremely friendly and helpful, but the rest of the staff was less animated and warm .\\nalso the wine gathering with the manager the one day i did attempt to attend it was so badly orgonised that i couldnt get to the table to get my wine so i just went tot he bar and had a drink there, but on the whole it was a great hotel and certain members of staff lift it out of the good to the great hotel that i experianced  !\\nThe staff was very helpful in giving us suggestions and directions when we asked .\\nVery close to Fisherman's Wharf, a grocery store located right across the street, and very helpful

to recommending an amazing restaurant .\\nThis hotel seems to get very mixed reviews, particularly about the reception desk staff .\\n I can only think that some of the staff are very good and some equally bad, since our experience was a very positive one .\\nDIsappointed in Front Desk Staff and Room Size\\nThe front desk staff couldn\\u0092t even be bothered to greet us hello .\\nThe staff at

empty .\\nConcierge service was fine when we needed our boarding pass printed .\\n Room service was expensive in the hotel .\\n Even with the amount we saved on the room, we could not justify spending the amount they listed for room service .\\nClose to everything ,  underground eating, Michigan avenue shops ,  walking or short cabNegatives,  Room service expensive ,  ridiculously expensiveParking expensive ,  $52 per dayFitness center cost $15 per day\\n I won't be staying here again until I hear that they have upgraded this service .\\nFantastic view excellent service ,  top notch !\\n The

or the pool and they have technology to remember the guests name when you call the concierge or the guest service they will address you by name .\\nWhile the Swissotel may not have the super high end service and ammenities   that some of the top tier hotels have, it is a very nice hotel that I would have no problems recommending to anyone .\\n The fitness center has good equipment, and room service arrives even faster than they predict in their estimates .\\n The internet service is reliable and fast, and the desk in the room is large .\\n The Menu Prices for room service Forget it !\\n I have in the past called Guest Services for the loan of a mini, fridge which was previously installed in the room with no problem  this time round, I was told there was a flat US$50 fee for this, irrespective of the duration of the stay .\\n Also worth mentioning is that this can be quite a 'conference' destination which can make things very busy if you are staying during one of these events  service can be slow and erratic, and the wait for elevators can be long and frustrating !\\n Some of the concierge staff were abit chilly at times, but the housekeeping service staff were extremely friendly and cheerful .\\n Too bad on several days, they were not able to service the room until late afternoon .\\n We ordered room service for breakfast and were not disappointed .\\n My father and

.\\nExceptional View and Fabulous Service .\\n They have demonstrated a wonderful ability to deliver consistent service and go above and beyond .\\n He got our heavy bags inside, showed us around the room, explained about room service, etc .\\n There\\u0092s a reason why it\\u0092s not the Holiday Inn and I\\u0092m assuming you stay there because of the amenities they offer and the service and location and views afforded and so no, you\\u0092re not going to pay corner diner prices at an upscale hotel .\\n Mom didn\\u0092t want to walk too far at night, so after leaving Navy Pier   we came back to the room and I ordered room service for just the second time in my life .\\n But the service just can\\u0092t be beat .\\n Ordering soup on room service will set you back around $20 \\n, with the tray charge, service charge and taxes making up the bulk of it .\\n For the location and comfort of the new rooms, this is the perfect hotel, however come armed with your credit card as they appear to be funding the refurbishment through room service and mini bar charges, not to mention the room rates .\\n We appreciated the elegant service and manner of the staff .\\n rooms, service,

as bountiful, although the cafe staff is inpeccable and extremely gracious and will bring you what you wish  check in staff not at all eager to upgrade you, even though you may be a frequent visitor .\\n The person at the front desk said for room service to fill out the menu or go to the Palm restaurant and they would bill it to our room .\\n30 and they said we needed a voucher and mentioned nothing of room service, we did get the voucher and enjoyed a very good breakfast buffet in their 2nd restaurant, not the Palm like we were toldWhen we were checking out we asked why we got charged for the pool when it states the package comes with it and it says in their books in the room that its free .\\n Not sure why hotels don't seem to understand that their guests opinion of the hotel is influenced more by housekeeping services than it is by how ornate the lobby decor is .\\n Internet service worked fine with a $10 daily charge .\\n Room service was extortionate though, very very expensive, so we didnt bother, as food outlets a few minutes walk away .\\n We were overcharged by $27 on a couple club sandwiches and drinks we ordered from room service .\\nNice location TERRIBLE service .\\n The rooms are very nice , the location is excellent, but the service is Terrible !\\n They had fantastic service there,  pricey, but so worth it .\\n To use the gym or pool was a $15 a day charge, to print our boarding passes was a $6 dollar charge and internet service was a $9 a day charge .\\nThe rooms were spotlessly clean and serviced each day .\\n Bell Service was helpful in arranging a van cab to take us to the airport .\\n Concierge service from our experience was good from one but bad from another so if you don't get good help the first time you ask, just go ask again

getting very cool despite putting the thermostat to 60F so I contacted guest services and they sent an engineer straightaway while we were sightseeing for the day .\\nSERVICEEveryone was efficient, no big lines for check, in or check, out .\\n Also, they charge exorbitant prices for mini, bar items and room service meals, so be prepared for that .\\n Clean and comfortable with friendly service and a convenient Chicago location .\\n A very recent survey mentioned that most high end hotels are no longer offering the service or will not in the near future .\\nfront desk staff need customer service 101 .\\n You can get better customer service elsewhere for much less .\\n Service with a smile always !\\n And to offer nothing to the woman who paid in advance and booked in advance, , , , , terrible customer service .\\nBeautiful view and bathroom, , , , terrible service and overall management .\\n I had breakfast in the hotel restaurant and room service .\\n Room service, however, was prompt and good .\\n stayed at swissotel for 5 nights ,  just myself and two children   all the staff could not have been more welcoming, the room service was prompt and efficient and not overly expensive .\\n3 We had an Executive Room which granted us access to the 42nd floor Executive Lounge with day, round complimentary beverage service   and pastries, and free Internet Access .\\n4 The restaurant and bar service on the ground floor was OK, but during our stay, the lobby was always really full of other guests .\\n The last remark in fact goes for the whole room, the cleaning service was perfect and the room recently renovated .\\n6 Make sure to sign up for the Club Swiss Gold bonus program before your stay for better front desk service and it will strengthen your chances of a free upgrade .\\n The rooms were very clean, the service was polite and helpful, and it's near the heart of Chicago !\\n We could not have been more pleased with the service, location, as well as the room and its view .\\n On top of all of this, the concierge was so unhelpful and unknowledgeable that we called the W Hotel to use their services .\\n In my eyes that is a step up from stealing because we did not utilize the mini bar, room service or the business center .\\n The room was nice, but the service was horriable .\\n Room service food quality was very good but with a $7 tray charge plus 20% service, I then absolutely refuse to tip for delivery .\\n The staff was wonderful, our room was very comfortable with an amazing view of the Chicago River and Michigan Ave, Room service was superb   .\\n I left the hotel for 4 hours in the afternoon with the do, not, disturb sign removed, but it was not serviced when I returned .\\nOverall, the hotel is a comfortable business hotel, but could stand to improve its service .\\n Could have had a bit nicer service .\\n I ended up ordering room service .\\n Altogether a nice and modern business hotel with all kind of service, but nothing with individuality and charme .\\n Room service was good and the staff extremely friendly .\\n When you do find the ice, it is in a service area often cluttered with maid carts .\\nService is excellent, the personnel strive to make you feel better .\\n One very simple, but very appreciated touch was the water service in the front lobby .\\n Overall, this hotel from top to bottom ,  service, furnishings, beds, appeal ,  is akin to a mediocre Holiday Inn .\\n The furniture was a little worn but the hotel's service and location made up for it .\\n We enjoyed the breakfast although the other evening food service was a bit skimpy .\\n We hired a babysitter through a great nanny service .\\nthe hotel was great, the service was wonderful and room service was quick .\\n Room service got my breakfast order wrong but

did not receive a response .\\n The customer service stinks .\\n00 through an online hotel booking service .\\n The bell service at the front door was nice, opening the door of the cab when we arrived and always saying hello when we were entering or leaving the hotel but the reception and concierge service was not as polite, often making us feel like we were troubling them for recommendations or when asking about buses and maps .\\n They did give us an extra bed for our little girl after we requested it but having stayed in the hampton inn and suites, milwaukee the days before, i have to say the service was poorer .\\ncom $200 per night but wish we had stayed with the hilton group for our stay in chicago s they seem to be more reasonably priced and more customer service based .\\n Chicago is fantastic and i would recommend giordinos pizza  , we also did the chicago bus co tour, we paid fpr a 3 day pass which was worth the money because it is a hop on and off service and can be used to save your legs when you start to get tired .\\n The room itself had worn carpets, some scratched furniture and leaky showerhead, butthe maid service was generally prompt and efficient .\\n The rooms were comparable but I have to admit I loved the Fairmont service, especially the bellhops and front desk .\\n Swissotel needs some training on customer service .\\n we had to go up a floor and into a service area to find ice .\\n The hotel is in a great location, the staff is friendly and very service, oriented .\\nLarge rooms and excellent service .\\n Got Swissotel for a very good price, but was a little anxious since some of the reviews on this site complained of slow elevator service, unhelpful staff, etc .\\n The elevators were always quick and in service, and the views of Navy Pier as you walk off the elevators are spectacular .\\n If you are interested in going to Navy Pier, there is a free trolley service on the side of the Hyatt hotel, you can catch, just make sure it has the yellow star on the trolley .\\n I would recommend this hotel, they gave great service even though we booked with [, , ] .\\n Service at the front desk was very friendly and efficient while room, service

absolutely excellent = full service, from front desk, to health club attendants, to business center personnel .\\nIf without transport, the Swissotel is regularly serviced by the Continental Airport Express shuttle .\\n You'll pay hotel prices for breakfast, but the price was on par or slightly below breakfasts that we've had via room service at other hotels .\\n The lunches are reasonably priced and the service is great .\\n Room service quality was great, but the prices were outrageous .\\n It exhibits neither Swiss efficiency nor American service .\\nValet service is a joke,  takes forever to get the car, and then they stand right next to you until you tip them .\\n Everything was wonderful, including the staff and service .\\n Now on the side of the service andstaff, there is a real &quot snobbish&quot  attitude that isprobably related to the fact that the Swedish, Germanprogeny of Europe work at the hotel, except as luggagehandlers, toilet cleaners and car parkers .\\n So, in all, I would definitely stay hereagain, even though the service stinks, the restaurantis for rich patrons with money to blow and the peopleare snobs, the rooms make up for it .\\ngreat breakfast great view and great service .\\n I had also stayed at the Swissotel Boston several years ago and this was a much different experience from a service point of view .\\n The internet access guest services movie selection didn't work either .\\n I had a note slipped under my door early Friday morning telling me that they were working on the guest services movie thing and that they hoped to have it back working that night .\\n Service was great as I was greeted immediately by bellstaff from my taxi and the desk person greeted me with a great smile .\\n There was no evening turndown service or complimentary bottled water .\\n Room service is limited after 10 p .\\n The worst were the clorox, like smell on that floor and the level of service provided by the staff .\\nSwissotel offered all the services extras I like , ,  lots of cabs, in, hotel bar, great views, room service, etc .\\n I did not find the service staff to be above average in any way, with the exception of the lovely concierge .\\n Honestly, I would rate the service and location a three, the rooms a four, and the view a five !\\n We were very pleased with the hotel and with the service .\\n The room had not been serviced and we were not pleased .\\n There is no actual Spa, its just a service they make an appointment with and they come to the hotel, , so the services are overpriced .\\n Room service was efficient, average priced, and decent food .\\n I ordered room service late on Saturday night, and the gentlemen who brought it up was one of the most pleasant people I encountered in Chicago !\\n Although my key card always malfunctioned   the service was top notch .\\n We spent last weekend at the Swissotel and were delighted with the service, the views and the amenities .\\n The maid who had provided turn, down service had also turned on the radio, so &quot Take Five&quot  accompanied the fireworks .\\n Great views, bathrooms  , and room service .\\n Never had a problem with any service personnel .\\n The service we experienced was top notch and everyone was extremely pleasant .\\n I ate their last night and the food and service were top noch .\\nI had a great experience here from the quality of the lobby, to the quality of the room, to the view, to the room service, to the food .\\n Comfortable beds, friendly service, not as many noisy sirens !\\n While the rooms are quite nice, I was dismayed by the snotty service I received at the Swissotel in Chicago .\\n While our lakeview room was spectacular   I was very disappointed with the room and the service at this hotel .\\n As for service issues, the concierge gave us erroneous info about the Navy Pier trolley  the maid failed to replace toiletries and towels, despite a $3 tip that had been left I normally tip $1, 2 per day and wait until the day we leave to tip the maid, but I decided to try something different this time since we were at a 4\\n potential, but is probably in need of a renovation and some intense customer service training for its staff .\\nBreakfast perfect and service really good .\\n Beautiful hotel with great service and location .\\n This is a great hotel with no customer service focus .\\n It amazes me that a hotel of this caliber does not understand customer service .\\n Also, room service told me that I could not order scrambled eggs because it was after 11 AM .\\n Very disappointing from a service perspective .\\n The hotel is advertised to have multiple restaurants, but that was not the case either , ,  other than room service the only option for dinner is The Palms restaurant which is very overpriced for the quality of the food .\\n Just don't ask anyone to provide you with outstanding service !\\n Service was friendly and courteous .\\n My family and I recently stayed in the Chicago hotel,   and I was so completely disappointed in both the room and the service that not only will I never stay in one of their facilities again, but I will certainly encourage all of my friends and family to do the same .\\n We travel extensively and I can tell you that the scenario in Chicago could have been avoided had the manager taken any amount of time to use some form of customer service .\\n, followed shortly thereafter by a knock and a housekeeper telling us our sign wasn't out  the hotel's extremely limited cable service    our housekeeper didn't refill replace our shampoo or shower gel our entire stay, nor did she empty all of our trash bins at any one time  our room service on two occasions brought us cold soggy, , and very late, , food  the lobby bar closes at 9 p .\\n I recommend this high class hotel with perfect service and will stay there again .\\n Service was european and elegant .\\n Great service, nice view, nice room .\\n My husband and I had one of our most memorable hotel experiences at the Suisse due to the service .\\n Just stayed for one night but did not receive the service one would expect from a 4 star hotel .\\n Our last hotel stay downtown was at the Sofitel &amp  I felt the service and hotel were much better .\\n Service was good ,  efficient and polite .\\n This restaurant is within the hotel but seems to operate independantly so you cannot order room service from the Palm but you can get take out and then have plates utensils delivered from room srevice .\\n By the way, all housekeeping and room service requests are handled promptly .\\n Spend your money for a nicer hotel just off the lake or off Michigan avenue for real top notch service .\\n I cannot comment on room services, however the staff in the front desk were professional and helpful .\\n Exceptional rooms and service !\\n Service was excellent and the suites were large and comfortable .\\nBeautiful Hotel ,  Service Slightly Lacking .\\n Great service in there, and a nice quiet place to grab a drink and just talk .\\n\",\n          \" The room was not overly big, but clean and very comfortable beds, a great shower and very clean bathrooms .\\n The second room was smaller, with a very inconvenient bathroom layout, but at least it was quieter and we were able to sleep .\\n Large comfortable room, wonderful bathroom .\\n The rooms were nice, very comfy bed and very clean bathroom .\\n Bathroom was spacious too and very clean .\\n The bathroom only had a single sink, but it was very large .\\n The room was a standard but nice motel room like any other, bathroom seemed upgraded if I remember .\\nThe room was quite small but perfectly formed with a super bathroom .\\n You could eat off the bathroom floor it was so clean .\\n The bathroom door does the same thing, making the bathroom seem slightly larger .\\nbathroom spotless and nicely appointed .\\n The rooms are exceptionally clean and also the bathrooms .\\n The bathroom was clean and the bed was comfy .\\n They provide you with great aveda products in the bathroom .\\n Also, the bathroom was a bit dirty ,  brown water came out of the bath tub faucet initially and the sink wall by the toilet was dirty .\\n If your dog tends to be a little disruptive or on the noisy side, there is a bathroom fan that you can keep on to make noise .\\n The bathroom was big and clean as well .\\n Also, the bathrooms were quite well set up, with a seperate toilet shower to basin, so whilst one guest is showering another can use the basin .\\n The bathroom was marble and we had luxurious bathrobes and really, every detail attended to .\\n It was very clean, had a beautiful bathroom, and was comfortable .\\n The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was clean with a nice selection of toiletries .\\n The bathroom was an adequate size .\\nFirst, from day one our bathroom had a urine smell that never went away .\\n Otherwise the bathroom was decent enough ,  decent temperature and decent water pressure .\\n Bathroom shower curtain reeked of mildew enough to smell up the room .\\n The bed was comfortable and the rooms and bathrooms were kept clean and although the refrigerators are honour bars the hotel is happy for you to chill your own drinks in them .\\n The room was very nice, and had a nice bathroom .\\n The room was wonderful with great beds, a nice bathroom and we also had an excellent view of Coit Tower as well .\\n The room was small, with a king bed, and a truly claustrophobic bathroom .\\nAmenities ,  While this hotel isn't a luxury property, they have some nice touches like marble bathrooms, mini bar, room service and an evening wine reception every day   .\\n The bathroom was clean, well lit, and always well stocked with shampoo etc and towels .\\n The only odd thing was the bathroom door and room door opened outwards into the room and hallway respectively .\\n Room spacious 2 double beds gave us plenty of room, the beds were comfortable and the bathroom was a good size .\\n The bathroom was large and included a mounted makeup mirror .\\n The rooms are abit smallish  , but immaculately maintained, and tastefully decorated, with excellent bathroom facilities .\\n Shower bathroom was good with good shower and plenty of space .\\n Both the bedroom and bathroom had plenty of room .\\n large clean bathrooms fully stocked with everything needed .\\n However, when we arrived at our room there was a maintenance worker there measuring the bathroom counter, so maybe they're doing work in some units .\\n The room was large and very comfortable with a nice large bathroom .\\n There is a wall, mounted hair dryer in the bathroom .\\nThe thing that bothered me the most was the bathroom was very dated .\\n There is virtually no counterspace in the bathroom at all .\\n Upon our arrival, there was a SLIGHT odor in bathroom but nothing worth complaining about .\\n The bathroom was adequate with thick, fluffy towels .\\n The bathroom was large and private .\\n The bathroom was very clean and well appointed with nice towels and toiletries, it was not big, but room enough to do what one needs to .\\nThe Tuscan Inn room was quite nicely appointed, the bed was comfortable the chairs   TV adequate, the bathroom reasonably good .\\nmy only real complaint would be that the bathroom does not have a separate vanity area, so 2 people getting dressed had to improvise, which was kind of surprising since the bathrooms were all redone on 2005 .\\n The clever use of mirrors behind the bed helped to create the illusion of space, however, in reality the room was cramped and with two of us trying to use the hand basin and bathroom at the same time was particularly awkward .\\n The bathroom containing the toilet and the shower was also very small, not to mention the sink and counter directly outside of it .\\n Turning the bathroom light on also turns the counter light on, meaning a middle, of, the, night trip to the bathroom means the whole side of the room gets illuminated  and the wooden shutters that were installed in place of traditional curtains to add to the hotel's theme do absolutely nothing to keep the room dark once the sun comes up .\\n The room was a good size but the bathroomm was very small .\\n Bathroom was adequate and clean and there was a hairdryer .\\n The wash basin was in the room without any privacy and there was a small bathroom for the toilet and bath shower .\\n The bathroom had not been remodeled in alignment, but it was all very clean and perfectly acceptable .\\n The bathroom had several problems .\\n Bathrooms were also very nice .\\n The shower stall could have been bigger as the bathroom itself was pretty large .\\n Then they gave us a room which had a view of a wall, a tiny bathroom so small in fact that the sink had to be in the bedroom .\\n The room is not the most modern room but there was tons of space especially in the bathroom .\\n We may have had an ADA room because it was pretty big with large bathroom ,  it was room 459 ,  and the room had all the amenities we were looking for .\\nThe room   and bathroom were perfect in size,  just what is needed .\\n The only possible complaint was that the sink in the bathroom had a crack in it, but it did not bother me enough to ask for a different room .\\n Bathrooms, though, are plenty big .\\n Although the rooms were clean and fresh, one of ours had several small problems ,  the phone didn't work, the bathroom door handle was quite loose, and the thermostat didn't work properly .\\n It represents value for money, the rooms and bathrooms were impeccably clean, fresh linen daily, and the staff extremely helpful and friendly .\\n There were plenty of thick towels in the bathroom, and all the usual toiletries, hair, dryer, etc .\\n I really didn't get a chance to experience the staff's level of service but the rooms are small as is the bathroom .\\n The bathroom was also small  it was difficult to close the door once inside to avoid the door hitting you no joke !\\n Some rooms had the bathroom sink outside the bathroom, which we would have preferred, but our sink was inside the bathroom .\\n The bathroom was clean and bright and the toiletries   were so good that we took the leftovers home because there was a website selling the shampoo listed on the bottle .\\n The rooms were very nice, could of use just a little more shelf space by the bathroom sink .\\n The bathroom was clean but a little dated .\\n The only thing wrong with the room was the bathroom, it was not up to the standard of the rest of the decor but it was clean and large enough .\\n The bathroom was just okay, but for the price we survived .\\n Hair dryer in bathroom constantly fell in sink from it's holder when anyone used the door to our room .\\n The reasonable price of the hotel allowed us to book 2 rooms, thus giving the 4 of us a bit more space and 2 bathrooms   .\\n Plenty of room in the bathroom .\\n Nice clean rooms and a spaciousbathroom .\\n The only minor downside, as a few others have mentioned, is the bathroom sink lighting .\\n Did not like the bathroom light shining into bedroom   .\\n Only negative is the bathroom area is a little small .\\n Our suite we had was small there was pubic hair on the bathroom floor from  ?\\nbathroom a little on the older side .\\n The bathroom needed a face, lift also .\\n The bathrooms are quite small compared to other hotels but adequate .\\n The hotel was of a good standard, big clean rooms, decent bathroom and the free wine reception in the evening was an added bonus .\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n

5th gen as a replacement for my 2nd gen nano .\\n the pedometer is also very nice but seems like it drains the battery if you have it in  always on  mode .\\n  The new Nano has a very short battery life most likely due to all the new features .\\n Very easy to use, love the pedometer, lightweight, thin, nice screen, great sound, battery lasts much longer than stated  .\\n Easy to use, Great

it in there and its playing well them go to move or something and it slides out .\\n Picture and sound quality are excellent for this typ of devic .\\n Great sound, easy to load & use once I read the instructions .\\n The music I loaded sounds clear and crisp .\\n As for the overall sound I would give it a 8 out of 10, and the volume offers itself loud enough to tune out everything else at your

picture is\\n Good sound and useful as a radio but that\\n\",\n          \" After I plugged it in to my USB hub on my computer to charge the battery the charging cord design is very clever !\\n After you have paged tru a 500, page book one, page, at, a, time to get from Chapter 2 to Chapter 15, see how excited you are about a low battery and all the time it took to get there !\\n NO USER REPLACEABLE BATTERY, , Unless you buy the extended warranty for $65 .\\n After 1 year you pay $80 plus shipping to send the device to Amazon and have the Kindle REPLACED, not the battery changed out   .\\nThe fact that Kindle 2 has no SD card capability and the battery is not user, serviceable is not an issue with me .\\n Things like the buttons that made it easy to accidentally turn pages  the separate cursor on the side that could only select lines and was sometimes hard to see  the occasionally awkward menus  the case which practically forced you to remove it to use it and sometimes pulled the battery door off .\\n The issue with the battery door opening is thus solved, but Amazon went further, eliminating the door altogether and wrapping the back with sleek stainless steel .\\n Frankly, I never used either the card slot or changed the battery on my Kindle 1 but I liked that they were there and I miss them on the Kindle 2, even though, I have to admit, I don't actually need them .\\n It's also easy to charge the Kindle in the car if you have a battery charger with a USB port   .\\n You can't carry an extra battery ,  though with the extended battery life and extra charging options it's almost a non, issue ,  and you can't replace the battery because of the iPod, like fixed backing .\\n For one thing, there's no charge except battery power no pun intended !\\n Before purchasing, I was obsessed with the reviews and predictions I found online and reading about some of the critiques such as the thick border, the lack of touchscreen, lack of battery SD slot, lack of a back light, awkward difficult keyboard layout, minimally faster page flipping, and the super, high price .\\n As for the battery, Amazon's explanation was that it'd thicken the Kindle, so I'm fine with it b c the slenderness of the K2 is such a plus .\\nShort battery life ,  I charged this thing for a couple of hours, 24 hours ago ,  it's still running and just at 75% of full power .\\n I turned it on, noticed there was about a half a battery charge and proceeded to find my way around the thing .\\nFourth, your battery icon stinks .\\n It is so subtle that you can't tell how much battery life is left .\\nKindle is an  out of the box  reading, ready unit that immediately addressed me by my nickname, no log, in necessary, and could have begun downloading whatever I wanted over the 3G Whispernet within seconds as the battery was charging,\\nvery thin, light, weight, and attractive, looking with more data storage and faster battery charges with longer usage compared to Kindle 1,\\nWhat I'm ambivalent about ,  I don't find the battery life any better than the K1, I thought the K1 battery life was perfectly fine .\\n extended use of this feature will cut into battery life significantly, I've been getting 2 .\\nbecause the battery ran down .\\nA week ago, I ordered my Kindle 2 and when it was delivered, the battery was in critical stage and it would not power on .\\n When that came in, it was also in the critical battery stage and this time the charge light would not even come on upon charging .\\n Battery life is very good, even with the wireless on constantly .\\n K2 goes into sleep mode if you leave it be for a few minutes, but in this mode it still uses battery power if wireless is enabled .\\n Many have been critical of the non user replaceability of the battery .\\n I can do without the K2 several years from now for a week while the battery gets replaced .\\n More likely, by the time the battery no longer holds a charge, there will be a K7 with a color screen and 200 times the memory that I'll want to upgrade to !\\n,  Battery life is weeks at a time, even with constant use .\\n And the battery life has gotten a lot shorter too, again, after TONS of use .\\n which, I guess, is unavoidable with rechargable batteries, but I wish I could change the battery myself .\\n The battery was almost fully charged upon receipt so I turned it on and I was in business .\\n Good thing the nook boasts a removable back cover, because the store clerk had to take it off to remove the battery for a hard restart .\\nBattery life is pretty spot on .\\n The 2 days battery life was with the wireless turned ON which is wholly unneccesary in the normal operation of the device .\\nTurn wireless OFF ,  It saves your battery .\\n And I like the fact the wireless is a menu option, I just leave it on all the time anyways with little perceptible battery drain .\\n,  Battery life seems a bit longer but the K1 was good too .\\n The Sony takes 60 seconds   to go back to the main menu and used an incrediable amount of battery .\\nThe original Kindle had a removable battery and you could buy extra batteries in case you'd be away from a power source for an extended time .\\n The battery in the Kindle 2 is not removable by the owner .\\n The Sony is smaller and thinner and, I think, has longer battery life .\\n It's not clear how big an advantage it is to have the extra battery life, though, because both get you through a long day with power to spare .\\n the screen is small, and the battery doesn't last long enough to be used in the way I use books .\\n The battery charged quickly, in less than 2 hours .\\n If I didn't have a reading lamp handy, I find that the  Mighty Bright  clip on battery operated book light that amazon .\\nwould no doubt run down the Kindle 2's battery faster .\\nSo far, the battery charge seems to last quite a long time for reading .\\n I leave the wireless access feature turned off for longer battery life .\\n So far, it has taken anywhere from two to three hours to recharge the device, depending on how far down I've let the battery run .\\nI'm not pleased with the prospect of having to send the unit in to have the battery replaced when it finally fails and won't take or hold a charge .\\n Apparently the Kindle 1 had a battery the owner could replace quickly, the way a cell phone does .\\nSo I give the Kindle 2 an A, minus, the minus because the battery isn't replaceable by the end user .\\nSo my only real complaint right now is a battery the end, user can't replace .\\n And the lack of backlight saves on the battery .\\n I can leave it on sleep for days and hardly ever need to recharge the battery .\\n3The battery definitely does not last two weeks on mine .\\n With 2, 3 hours of reading per day, my Kindle battery has lasted me only 4 days .\\n No idea what battery life is like because I just gave it to her .\\n>> Better battery life, FAR better with wireless function on .\\n To me, this is more important than a user, replaceable battery .\\n>> It has a user, replaceable battery, though this is offset by improved life with the built, in Kindle 2 battery .\\n The battery life is disappointing ,  with the wireless on, it probably wouldn't last 20 hours of determined reading .\\n A single battery charge of my Kindle lasts almost two weeks compared to the 3, 4 hours on my iphone or the 5, 6 hours on my netbook .\\n Besides, I don't want to make the tradeoff of inferior battery life in order to power a device, native backlight .\\n Plus the touch screen consumes battery life .\\n4,  I like that you can change the battery in the Nook and you can add a memory card .\\n However I have IPods and I never use up all the memory or battery life .\\n Plus the Kindle 2's Battery life is 4 days longer per charge .\\nOh and one more thing ,  I've discovered that if you turn of  wifi    until you know you need to send or retrieve something, the battery lasts for many many more hours .\\n A clip, on light seems like a fine solution, plus it doesn't drain the battery .\\n,  The battery life seems fine to me .\\n I left wireless on for the first 3 days, and after reading through  Ur  and 25% of  DaVinci Code , plus lots of general playing around with the device and checking out features, I got the low, battery warning about 55 hours after intially charging it to full .\\n This feature uses a lot of battery and the battery lasts for maximum 2, 3 days but it is worth it .\\nI live in the UK, my Kindle arrived last Thursday and it was up and running in minutes as the battery had some charge when it arrived .\\nThe Kindle does not come with a UK power adaptor, so that has been an extra \\u00a312 expense, but I could charge the battery using the computer and USB cable .\\n The battery life is unbelievable too .\\n Also, I only carried my kindle on the plane to Japan, and I could read for over 15 hours and the battery wasn't even halfway over .\\n The books download quickly, the battery lasts a long time, it is simple to use, the bookmark feature is nice, and I love the cool pics on the screen when you turn the gadget off .\\n The battery life is great and I even like the screen savers .\\n I just found out how to save the battery and you can read for well over a week without a charge .\\n If the battery lasts a couple years, not being able to replace it myself will not be a factor either .\\n I've left the wireless on and really don't see tremendous battery usage yet .\\nAt first I thought,wait a minute,no memory chip,no exchangeable battery,a few other diff .\\nIt came with battery uncharged, but it charged up as advertised in less than 3 hours .\\n And the long battery life is amazing !\\n The battery life seems amazing .\\n While the Kindle 2 shows the title on the left as before and more readable, the battery life and network icons are in the place of the author's name .\\n By the way, Kindle battery lasts forever indeed !\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"cluster_label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n

temp with trip odometer .\\n needs power seats on the passenger side .\\n I haven't had any back pain from the seats, maybe these people exceed the seat weight limit ?\\n There is a great deal of road noise in the cabin and the seats are very low quality .\\nPower seats are not fully adjustable .\\n Front seats are too narrow and not deep enough .\\n The seats are extremely uncomfortable .\\n I previously owned a 98 Avalon, and found the seats more comfortable than the Honda .\\n The seats in the Honda are more firm .\\n I'm very sad ,  I loved my daughter's Civic and the dealer service is fantastic, but even good service can't help the uncomfortable seats .\\n It cost me thousands of dollars to get rid of it, but the seats gave me and my wife back pain after 20 minutes of driving !\\n Although it is fun to drive and quality seems ok, the leather seats are very uncomfortable, especially on a long drive .\\n The seats are decent, the interior design is excellent IMO as well as the exterior design, and thus far it has been extremely reliable .\\n In fact, I love the car just wish Honda wouldn't have made such horrible seats .\\n Body wasn't used to seats like if you bought a new mattress .\\n The interior quality is OK, my 1999 Accord EX had a better comfort level on the seats .\\nI just purchased an Accord Sedan   with leather seats .\\n Only needs to add drivers seat memory, 2, tone perforated leather, xenons, rear seat interior illumination mounted under front seats, and better tilt .\\n I can also fit three car seats in the back which was the reason I was able to go back the the Honda family .\\n The seats are very comfortable & supportive .\\n I test drove an EX, L and felt the seats were too firm plus, the EX, L seemed too slow .\\n This Accord has more road noise than I like and the seats tend to be hard, unlike my other Accords .\\n Engine performance lacks punch after 60, head rest are poor design, lacks driver seat memory rear seat a c, radio system is marginal compared to Bose, Seats are hard and small for a large person .\\n The seats are comfortable, and there is ample leg room in the front and rear .\\n Most uncomfortable seats in any vehicle I have ever owned .\\n Only 2 things could make it better  memory seats and a smoother shifting transmission .\\n Seats are firm but not uncomfortable ,  very BMW like .\\n Advise anyone considering the L to drive one for awhile if you can ,  some cannot stand the seats .\\n The seat cover was coming out in between the seats .\\n The only for sure complaint I have is the seats seems to hurt my back after I drove for a period of time, this may be because I am use to my silverado truck with leather bucket seats .\\n DON'T rely on your test drive, the seats are Very uncomfortable and when the engine goes into the  econo  mode the vehicle  shifts rocks violently  forward and when leaving the  econo  mode it shifts rocks forward once again which means that the vehicle is  CONTINUOUSLY  SHAKING AND ROCKING .\\n Seats are very comfortable and ride is very smooth !\\n It's a black beauty with comfy leather seats .\\n The front seats are extremely uncomfortable after anything more than 15 minutes of driving due to what I see as a design flaw, the seat curvature is too great, and even with the lumbar support all the way retracted, it still feels like there is some type of bar sticking out in the wrong part of my back   .\\n However, long, distance comfort  is poor due to hard, narrow and deeply, bucketed seats combined with a very taut suspension which transmits even minor road imperfections through the whole vehicle .\\n At first the seats seemed stiffer than I'd like, but after making a 2 1 2 hour trip, It felt very comfortable once I got the seat and lumbar adjusted to my liking .\\n Great leg room in the back and the seats a very supportive .\\n Door closure is solid, leather seats are very comfortable .\\n Ride is very good, but seats are

look like they were just remodled and upgraded, there was an HD TV and a nice iHome docking station to put my iPod so I could set the alarm to wake up with my music instead of the radio .\\nGreat rooms staff and location but extras overpriced .\\n Hotel was very clean and the rooms were comfy .\\n the standard rooms are small, the lobby bar is very small   .\\n My son loved the Chicago river view from our 31st floor , rooms where neat and clean .\\n The rooms were small and much more expensive .\\n I've olny ever stayed in the 'standard' rooms in this property, all of which are spacious and airy, and function well for both business or leisure travellers .\\n Rooms all appear to either look out onto the river and the bustle of Chicago or, on the other side, will face Navy Pier,   .\\n But we really did spend very little time in our rooms .\\n The rooms were cleaned spic and span every day .\\n But I guess they have to make money somehow since they practically give their rooms away .\\n We were 2 rooms away from the elevators but could hear them clearly .\\n Building is shaped like a triangle and only has about 17 rooms on a floor, so very quiet and no hall noise .\\n The hotel is shaped like a triangle from the sky, and this strange shape combined with the location of the elevator shafts made many rooms quite noisy .\\n The view from the rooms is of the river and city, Lake Michigan or of Millennium Park .\\n The rooms were great, the staff was excellent .\\n The location of the hotel is perfect for shopping and local bars restaurants on the golden mile, and views from most rooms very good .\\nVery impressed with rooms and view !\\n They have just recently upgraded the hotel rooms and they are wonderful .\\n The rooms are bright and airy with wonderful beds and bedding .\\n The ideal location   coupled with great service and beautiful rooms makes for a wonder stay .\\n Very pretty rooms with an European flair .\\n no more bathrobes in corner rooms suites  coffee service in room is parred way down  the buffet offered in the cafe is not as bountiful, although the cafe staff is inpeccable and extremely gracious and will bring you what you wish  check in staff not at all eager to upgrade you, even though you may be a frequent visitor .\\n Locker rooms were clean and had a sauna .\\n Rooms are good quality and clean, what you would expect from a four star business hotel .\\n The rooms are large, the view was wonderful overlooking Navy Pier .\\n The rooms are very nice , the location is excellent, but the service is Terrible !\\n The rooms are spacious and pristine with pillow, top beds that made it almost impossible to get up in the morning because it was so comfortable .\\n We stayed in two rooms on the 22 floor in August with our two teenage daughters .\\nThe view from the rooms was fantastic,My daughters are allergic to feathers and all trace of them were removed from the room as soon as we advised housekeeping .\\nThe rooms were spotlessly clean and serviced each day .\\nWe   and, unfortunately, got to stay in three different rooms .\\n The rooms are very nice, well, appointed, with comfortable beds .\\n The recent renovation is great , ,  the guest rooms are really nice .\\n The rooms were large and clean .\\n The rooms are very clean, comfortable and spacious and up, to, date .\\n Rooms in similar hotels would usually be about $250, 300 .\\n It does suffer, however, from a trend that I have been noticing that as rooms at business class hotels are upgraded ,  particularly with a patch panel for the big LCD, TV ,  drawer space becomes less and less .\\n Why is the cleaning staff telling us they are out of coffee for the rooms ?\\nThe rooms were nice, clean and updated .\\n Had to move rooms and floors .\\n Our rooms   were still not ready by 8pm .\\nthe other two rooms were not clean .\\n They didn't charge us for the room, , , , but, also did not offer any type of compensation to the woman who arranged these rooms in FEBRUARY .\\n I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the rooms .\\n The room was two rooms from the elevators and I could still hear them but it wasn't too bad .\\nThe hotel and rooms were very clean .\\nGreat Location Nice Rooms Loved the Swissotel !\\n The rooms were very clean, the service was polite and helpful, and it's near the heart of Chicago !\\n Thanks to TravelZoo I was able to find an amazing deal ,  lakeside rooms for $129 night as part of a spring promotion .\\n The hotel looks like an office tower, the rooms look like converted boardrooms and the place has all of the charm of a Fortune 500 executive suite .\\n The rooms were clean and modern .\\n I ended up with a double on the 7th floor ,  I would've preferred a King since I was alone, but it was one of the renovated rooms so I decided to keep it .\\n The rooms are large and well, appointed  , the staff was very professional and friendly, and the view was striking !\\nGreat location but rooms need some work .\\n All on the way from Milwaukee I was telling her how everyone was so nice and the rooms are beautiful .\\n He then told me that they have no more rooms available and i was just going to have to deal with it since i was only staying a night .\\n I called from my cell phone and asked if they had any rooms available and they said yes its blah blah blah .\\n When I got to the room, I thought the new rooms would have a plasma since the website implies the new rooms would have them, but I guess those come later   .\\nI did notice that the bottles of water that they have in the rooms sell for $6 which I think is rediculous .\\n There were no king rooms available when we checked in and the woman at the front desk was not overly helpful until we produced a copy of our confirmation wtih the king bed request on it .\\n very nice pool and spa on the 42nd floor, rooms and lobby were clean, easy walk to Michigan Ave through via the lower level walkway to the Illinois State center, beds were comfortable .\\n The actual hotel and rooms were very nice with amazing views, the staff was extremely rude .\\n The rooms are spacious and have nice views, I was NOT impressed with the mattress and every, little, tiny thing costs money .\\n Very well equiped, the rooms are spacious and very comfortable with every thing you need .\\n from other rooms but not nearly bad enough for us not to stay there again .\\n We even got upgraded to one of the corner rooms   which also looked west toward Michigan Ave and the Wrigley building .\\n as the building rises the noise will get worse as they get closer to guest rooms .\\nI\\u0092ve stayed with my family at the hotel previously in two connecting rooms which were nice but unremarkable .\\n This time, no connecting rooms were available so we booked a one, bedroom, 1 .\\n In our case, it was cheaper than two connecting rooms and a far better experience .\\n Rooms at the hotel are getting somewhat tired .\\n Rooms in this hotel are noisy though .\\nI called in a few hours before check in time to see if any rooms were available for check, in, the operator connected me to the reservations desk .\\n Got to hotel, rooms weren't ready yet .\\nThe rooms were sleek and cool ,  great views .\\n I recieved a great deal on the rooms here and it was wonderful .\\n It was a good hotel, the rooms were clean and there were little things like dressing gowns that were a nice touch but other everyday things let the hotel down .\\n Our rooms were nice and didn't look worn or old .\\n The rooms were comparable but I have to admit I loved the Fairmont service, especially the bellhops and front desk .\\n The rooms are in pretty shabby condition, but they are clean .\\n While the rooms are a bit dated, the location is great .\\nThe bad side is that the rooms are dated and in need of some upgrades, but for $109 a night through Travelocity it was great .\\n Since we were staying during busy Memorial weekend all the good rooms filled up quickly .\\n Our family of 4 frequents Chicago and oftentime forgoes the comfort of a more spacious suite just to experience the thrill of the view of the river and Navy Pier that Swissotel's Lakeview rooms provide .\\n You can see downtown and or the Navy Pier from most of the rooms .\\nGreat Location great rooms and bed but no help from desk personnel .\\n There is simply no better way to experience the 4th of July in Chicago, than in one of the corner rooms with a view of Navy Pier .\\n Rooms very spacious and clean .\\nLarge rooms and excellent service .\\n The interior of the guest rooms is decidedly generic, lacking the style of some of Chicago's newer hotels   .\\n But the rooms are large and nicely equipped with all the essentials of a business hotel .\\n It seems most of the rooms here have great views and mine was no exception .\\n It could be an excellent property if the rooms were updated with new mattresses, televisions and desks .\\n The Fairmont and Hyatt next door have a few rooms with a view but not many .\\n Suspecting the rooms were allocated under the control of large travel agencies, I immediately called a friend and had them book me using hotels .\\n These rooms are right next to the elevators .\\n Contemporary in its decor, the rooms are spacious and the bathrooms are very nice .\\n For 2 nights there were 4 of us and for the last night only 2, so I was looking for 2 rooms or a room with 2 beds .\\n I originally booked 2 rooms because their online reservation site would only allow you to book a room for 1, 3 people and there was no guarantee that you would get a room with 2 double beds .\\nthe service staff always left our rooms clean, and even arranged my girlfreinds jewelry for her, untangling her necklaces and earrings from each other, and leaving them evenly placed on the bureau !\\nThe rooms were clean, and upscale for the low price we paid .\\nGreat Hotel with Great Rooms .\\n The rooms were very spacious and clean, especially for downtown Chicago standards .\\n Most importantly, the rooms were quiet .\\n The rooms and common areas were bland and far from a top flight hotel .\\n The hotel is really pretty, but the rooms need some upgrading to be considered anywhere near a 4 5 star hotel .\\nI would say the best part about this hotel was that it was very very quiet from inside the rooms .\\n The decor of the rooms and the communal areas is really dated, looks like it hasn't been touched for years .\\n The Swissotel was a great place to stay, rooms were very clean, and quiet at night for a great nights rest, with extremely comfortable beds, and high quality bedding .\\n We had a pretty bad view on the 27th floor relative to the other rooms which faced Lake Michigan   There's some construction right now Southwards and we stared at a giant mud pit with big cranes the entire visit .\\n So, in all, I would definitely stay hereagain, even though the service stinks, the restaurantis for rich patrons with money to blow and the peopleare snobs, the rooms make up for it .\\n Some of the other hotels in the same class in Chicago might be a little more decorative or chic but their rooms are not as comfortable and don\\u0092t seem to have the same dependable amenities that the Swissotel has .\\n Rooms were good, nothing spectacular about them except the views .\\n The beds were extremely comfortable, rooms were extremely spacious and the bathrooms were as well .\\n We didn't check out the normal rooms but my parents were in a &quot normal&quot  room and loved it, and said it was one of the nicest and most importantly cleanest they'd been in lately .\\n From talking to other guests, I concluded that rooms ending with numbers xx1, xx2, xxx19 and xx20 should be avoided unless you enjoy listening to elevators going up and down !\\nOne thing that struck me as backward is that they charge $10 per 24 hours of internet usage in certain guest rooms .\\n I pointed out to the manager that my firm held a conference there just months before and had used the conference facilities as well as several hotel rooms .\\n Honestly, I would rate the service and location a three, the rooms a four, and the view a five !\\n Then we were told that rooms on the top 5 or 6 floors are all non, smoking .\\n The hotel was very nice, rooms were big, the pool hot tub area was very nice, and the location was great and easy to get to .\\n It is true that the rooms have a little 'wear', but not to the point of being a problem .\\n Rooms are dated, our corner room's bathroom was shabby .\\n word to the wise, , avoid the rooms ending with 11 .\\n Rooms were clean, good sized and great views of Navy Pier .\\n The rooms were very clean and spacious .\\n While the rooms are quite nice, I was dismayed by the snotty service I received at the Swissotel in Chicago .\\n So, while the rooms are very nice, I will never stay at a Swissotel again, in any city .\\n Then again, the rooms are much larger and the view more than makes up for it .\\n The room was huge as hotel rooms go .\\n Rooms are lovely as well, with handsome fixtures and furniture, a terrific desk work space and comfortable bed .\\n Rooms were very comfortable and spacious with nice furniture, comfy bed, luxurious bathroom, great TV, etc .\\n There's also an indoor pool, large excercize room, and spacious men's and women's locker rooms on the top floor with floor, to, ceiling windows all around you .\\n The rooms are not all that big .\\n In fact we have always gotten the rooms with a view of the fireworks !\\n The rooms are spacious and I've never had any problems with noise,  they are much quieter than other hotels I've been at .\\n I called the front desk before we even set our suitcases down and asked if we could switch rooms .\\n At this point it was close to 2 pm and my first fear was that my family and I would be stranded in Chicago with no available rooms at a reputable hotel .\\n The views were amazing, the rooms were comfortable and the staff was always helpful whenever I had a question .\\n The views are fabulous, the rooms clean and roomy .\\n Large clean rooms and comfortable bed .\\n These rooms are very speceous and the beds are very comfortable .\\n The rooms were nice and the view was pretty good .\\n Exceptional rooms and service !\\n Hotel's architecture is nice, location near all point of interets and rooms are large, clean, quiet .\\n We showed them our Wyndham By, Request card and were told for doing this one of our rooms would be given a complimentary upgrade to a conceirge level room ,  not both rooms but one room .\\n Strange, we thought, since we had booked conceirge level rooms .\\nThe rooms with the Navy Pier view are beautiful and the restaurant on the lower level, Currents, was an excellent dining experience .\\n Alot of the common areas that I enjoyed so much   have been turned into areas such as large banquet rooms .\\n The rooms were clean and big and the view of the navy pier was incredible .\\n Expensive Parking but great rooms .\\n Rooms were nicely furnished .\\n Pool is nice with whirlpool and saunas in the locker rooms .\\n The rooms are business, oriented, so they are not as hip or stylish as, say, the Sutton Place or the W .\\n\",\n          \" Front seats are very uncomfortable .\\n No memory seats, no trip computer, can only display outside temp with trip odometer .\\n needs power seats on the passenger side .\\n I haven't had any back pain from the seats, maybe these people exceed the seat weight limit ?\\n There is a great deal of road noise in the cabin and the seats are very low quality .\\nPower seats are not fully adjustable .\\n Front seats are too narrow and not deep enough .\\n The seats are extremely uncomfortable .\\n I previously owned a 98 Avalon, and found the seats more comfortable than the Honda .\\n The seats in the Honda are more firm .\\n I'm very sad ,  I loved my daughter's Civic and the dealer service is fantastic, but even good service can't help the uncomfortable seats .\\n It cost me thousands of dollars to get rid of it, but the seats gave me and my wife back pain after 20 minutes of driving !\\n Although it is fun to drive and quality seems ok, the leather seats are very uncomfortable, especially on a long drive .\\n The seats are decent, the interior design is excellent IMO as well as the exterior design, and thus far it has been extremely reliable .\\n In fact, I love the car just wish Honda wouldn't have made such horrible seats .\\n Body wasn't used to seats like if you bought a new mattress .\\n The interior quality is OK, my 1999 Accord EX had a better comfort level on the seats .\\nI just purchased an Accord Sedan   with leather seats .\\n Only needs to add drivers seat memory, 2, tone perforated leather, xenons, rear seat interior illumination mounted under front seats, and better tilt .\\n I can also fit three car seats in the back which was the reason I was able to go back the the Honda family .\\n The seats are very comfortable & supportive .\\n I test drove an EX, L and felt the seats were too firm plus, the

lacks driver seat memory rear seat a c, radio system is marginal compared to Bose, Seats are hard and small for a large person .\\n The seats are comfortable, and there is ample leg room in the front and rear .\\n Most uncomfortable seats in any vehicle I have ever owned .\\n Only 2 things could make it better  memory seats and a smoother shifting transmission .\\n Seats are firm but not uncomfortable ,  very BMW like .\\n Advise anyone considering the L to drive one for awhile if you can ,  some cannot stand the seats .\\n The seat cover was coming out in between the seats .\\n The only for sure complaint I have is the seats seems to hurt my back after I drove for a period of time, this may be because I am use to my silverado truck with leather bucket seats .\\n DON'T rely on your test drive, the seats are Very uncomfortable and when the engine goes into the  econo  mode the vehicle  shifts rocks violently  forward and when leaving the  econo  mode it shifts rocks forward once again which means that the vehicle is  CONTINUOUSLY  SHAKING AND ROCKING .\\n Seats are very comfortable and ride is very smooth !\\n It's a black beauty with comfy leather seats .\\n The front seats are extremely uncomfortable after anything more than 15 minutes of driving due to what I see as a design flaw, the seat curvature is too great, and even with the lumbar support all the way retracted, it still feels like there is some type of bar sticking out in the wrong part of my back   .\\n However, long, distance comfort  is poor due to hard, narrow and deeply, bucketed seats combined with a very taut suspension which transmits even minor road imperfections through the whole vehicle .\\n At first the seats seemed stiffer than I'd like, but after making a 2 1 2 hour trip, It felt very comfortable once I got the seat and lumbar adjusted to my liking .\\n Great leg room in the back and the seats a very supportive .\\n Door closure is solid, leather seats are very comfortable .\\n Ride is very good, but seats are just a little firm .\\n Seats are not very comfortable and not happy with the heated seats .\\n The seats are very comfortable and I love the cloth

.\\n5 Seats= Like sitting on a church pew .\\n Leather seats are the only thing of good quality .\\n Problems with steering wheel, windows & seals, seats   .\\n Smooth responsive acceleration,top of the line high quality supple comfy leather seats .\\n Also, amazing leg space in front AND back seats ,  the Accord could almost be considered a full size sedan .\\n5L V6 scoots  sporty handling and acceleration good  sporty leather seats  highway gas mileage  appearance package worth having  no dealer service yet  Negatives :\\n First off the new body style is very appealing and the new seats are more forgiving for larger men .\\n The heated seats for me and my passenger are a plus for the cold weather .\\n hard seats, hard ride, more road noise than expected, disappointing gas mileage .\\n The seats are supportive and the materials are great .\\n You get a V, 6, heated leather seats, XM, 18  rims .\\n Cloth front seats big & comfortable .\\n Seats are stiff but once adjusted seem to become more comfortable .\\n The seats are very firm, but getting used to this .\\nThe seats in my 2008 which is just like a 2009 are considerably less than I'm used to from Honda .\\n The only hiccup I can report is that I think that the seats in our 2008 Odyssey are a bit more comfortable .\\n Don't get me wrong, the Accord is a comfortable car, I am just a big guy and the seats just feel like they could use a little more of something .\\n I have two herniated disks and the seats of the Honda have alleviated the pain in my legs and back when I drive .\\n Additionally, the standard

support on the seats is a life saver !\\n Front seats much more comfortable .\\n The satellite radio cuts out constantly, the heated seats are barely warm, the sound system is pathetic and the brakes wore out around 15,000 miles google it .\\n We are both tall, 5'11'' and 6'2  and have no problems with the seats .\\n After driving it for a few months I found the seats are tough on the lower back on long runs and it need a few more inches to go back .\\n Seats are too firm and leather is quite  hard  in character and feel .\\n I was slightly concerned about all the reviews with the seats being uncomfortable .\\n I love the seats, they are supportive .\\n\",\n          \"The wine reception is a great idea as it is nice to meet other travellers and great having access to the free Internet
