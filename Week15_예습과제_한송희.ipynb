because the price was so good but got a great room on the 16th floor facing the London Eye .\\n53

to a number of factors ,  the location, the price   the availibility of a room to accomodate three adults .\\n60                                                                                                                                           Another word of warning when booking through the Holiday Inn website ,  VAT was NOT included in the price at the time of booking until you actually processed the booking and paid for the room ,  this is apparently now normal for many London hotels which I'd never experienced before ,  we ended up paying \\u00a317 more per night than I'd expected

open, bathroom new , staff fine and concierge area knowledgeable and openly interested and helpful, the hotel really tries, dont nit pick small things, dont pay more than $120 max and if you want to at least check out other reliable hotels, there are many shockers at all price ranges, do your research  !\\n141

to a number of factors ,  the location, the price   the availibility of a room to accomodate three adults .\\n60                                                                                                                                           Another word of warning when booking through the Holiday Inn website ,  VAT was NOT included in the price at the time of booking until you actually processed the booking and paid for the room ,  this is apparently now normal for many London hotels which I'd never experienced before ,  we ended up paying \\u00a317 more per night than I'd expected

can't be beat .\\n140  After initial angst of getting a room, after a NY, London flight, I settled for a twin and not a double bedded room, 17th floor , small but very comfortable room, windows do open, bathroom new , staff fine and concierge area knowledgeable and openly interested and helpful, the hotel really tries, dont nit pick small things, dont pay more than $120 max and if you want to at least check out other reliable hotels, there are many shockers at all price ranges, do your research  !\\n141

3rd gear during first few minutes of driving .\\n5     The transmission is horrible, it shifts revs horribly at the wrong times, it putters when it hits 1 1 2 rpms while coasting unless you rev it or hit the breaks, if you try to start the car in really cold weather it makes a horrible grinding noise, the dash rattles ALL the time, when I try to accelerate getting on the freeway it doesnt move & scares me and when it does move it revs even after take your foot from the gas .\\n6

visibility because of high rear bumper, and a problem with its computer  learning  my  driving style .\\n12

hard cheap ones which are very very uncomfortable and give me back pain .\\n17                                                                                                                                             If you keep in mind that the Camry is a comfort car, you may even enjoy the experience .\\n18                                                                                                         While the 4 cylinder does not have the punch of the Honda Accord 4 cylinder, the comfort and quietness of the ride won out .\\n19

                                                                                                                                               I feel uncomfortable driving this car and will get rid of

quiet the cabin was and just how comfortable it was to sit in and drive .\\n23                                                                                                                                   This car offers poor driver's seat comfort, poor vision  , only average ride quality, gas mileage \\n24                                                                        We have had this Camry about two years now, and it is not a boring car but it is smooth, comfortable and has good road manner, and overall it is a good car .\\n25

Honda .\\n27                                                                                                                                                                                Looks are

               great ride, quiet comfortable spacious cabin, superior electronics  , fair price and good looks .\\n30                                                                                                         You can't have it both ways, either a car is full of power and stiff suspension or it's smooth and comfortable on the road .\\n31                                                                                                                                 The interior is very luxurious and comfortable, however the car feels slower than my 2002 Camry LE .\\n32                                                                                                                                                                    For the comfort and entertainment of the ride, I like the Camry .\\n33                                                                                                                                                                                            The driver's seat is really comfortable .\\n34                                                                                             I have had no transmission issues or rattling, the comfort and ride of this vehicle felt to me much more high end then what I had paid .\\n35                                                                                                                                                                    I love the look, and the comfort, but would never buy one again .\\n36    I've read other reviews stating that the leather seats were not comfortable for long drives due to lack of cushion support, but that's not been the case for me especially after recently driving from Houston to Key West, Fla .\\n37

disaster .\\n39                                                                                                                                                                                       Front seats are not comfortable on long trip .\\n40                                                                                                I was not sure at first about trading my 01 Honda Accord but have been more than satisfied with the performance, looks, and comfort .\\n41                                                                                                                                       A little stiffer ride than the xl and xle models I have had, but still comfortable and quiet .\\n42

flagship Camry .\\n45                                                                                       Over the month it was in the shop, we rented several different cars and nothing seemed to measure up to the comfort and options of the Camry .\\n46                                                                                                     The seat comfort is not as it was and I found that the gas, brake pedals are offset too much to the left of my body centerline .\\n47

                                                                                                                 Feels expensive, yet comfortable with larger interior than my Grand Prix .\\n50                                                                                                                                                                  Trunk is big and rear seat very comfortable for

Headroom body room comfort great for my 6'1  250 lbs .\\n52                                                                                                                I feel that the Camry just

           It looks awesome, turns like it's on rails, has a great sound system, and is just comfortable and fun to drive .\\n54

.\\n80                                                                                                                                          It is a very comfortable car that gives us options that we never had on previous vehicles .\\n81                                               I test drove and compared similar 4 door sedans like the Maxima, Accord, Mazda6, and noticed that none had all the features,performance,comfort ,safety,and looks that the Camry has .\\n82

                                                                                                   The seats were very comfortable on a four and a half hour   trip, and wind and road noise were minimal .\\n86                                                                                                                                 The interior is much more comfortable than my last 3 Camrys and the exterior styling is oh so chic .\\n87

       Comfort is great, mileage is good overall, better on the road than expected  , compared to my 1999 Camry .\\n89                                                                                   Having flown 26 different aircraft and driven cars for 61 years, I find the 2007 Camry to be the most uncomfortable cockpit I have every been in .\\n90                                                                                                The headrest presses into my head at an uncomfortable angle and it is imposssible to tell where the front of the car is for parking .\\n91                                                                                                                                                              The window sill is too high and the armrest too low to be comfortable .\\n92                                                                                                        The new looks are what attracted it to me initially, but its relatively smooth drive, comfort and reliability sold me on it .\\n93                                                                                                                    It is a beautiful sapphire blue, has really nice lines, is very comfortable, is plenty peppy, and hugs the road .\\n94                             The ride is very comfortable, although I'm 6'6  and I didn't think head room was an issue but I do think leg room could be better, I think this is mainly because the back seats have tons of leg room .\\n95

                                                               Overall this car is very quiet, comfortable, smooth, powerful, and absolutly the best mid, size in the current market .\\n97                                                                                                                                                                           Leather seats are comfortable, Nav system

and now the ride is even quieter and comfortable .\\n99                                                                                                                                                                                                     Leather seats were comfortable .\\n100

                                                 My conclusion after doing a ton of research regarding safety, reliability, comfort and gas mileage :\\n102                                                                                                                           the Hyundai Sonata is thousands of dollars cheaper and matches the Camry in all respects except comfort .\\n103                                                                                        Bottom line was that I was going to be in that driver's seat for years to come and I was not going to skimp on the critical comfort factor .\\n104                                                                                                                                                While the '03 was roomy and comfortable, the steering and handling were very vague .\\n105                           The interior is upgraded markedly, and although there is a bit less headroom, the added telescoping feature of the steering wheel combined with the greater travel of the seat   yields greater comfort .\\n106                                                                                                                                                   , a luxurious comfort feature, and a fuel consumption that is best in the class .\\n107

                                                                                                                                                       Top notch rating on interior comfort .\\n109

heat here in Arizona .\\n110                                                                                                                                                               Extremely comfortable with 3 separate power driver seat adjustments .\\n111                                                                                                                                                 I purchased a Camry LE approximately 2 months ago, it's a smooth comfortable ride .\\n112

                                                                                                                                               Very uncomfortable when driving long distances .\\n115

my F150 pickup on trips .\\n116                                                                                                                                                                      This car is easy to drive, great gas mileage and comfortable .\\n117

                           Vista has more features than XP, but many of them didn't make the OS more usable for me .\\n27   Personally I thought Vista was very handsome, what with its transparency, 3, D effects, color schemes, and usability improvements to Windows Explorer, and I believe Windows 7 continues that trend by looking just as sexy , ,  if not more , ,  while at the same time adding its own valuable features and enhancements .\\n28

                                    I can't tell what positives it offers still, but it's still a nifty upgrade with a lot of nifty features over XP that make for a more fun experience for some, and a more organized experience involving navigating huge catacombs of archives and files .\\n30

I don't have a TV Tuner, so I can't take advantage of that feature, but there are other features & it seems to be working good .\\n40                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       00 dollars just to upgrade for some fancy new features .\\n41                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Since my Google Sidebar had some features that I liked, it allowed me to replace it for the Windows one .\\n42                                                                                                                                                                                               Because others on this site have already described in sufficient detail all the amazing features of W7, I will not repeat them .\\n43                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             There are so many more features of this that are very difficult to list all here .\\n44                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         All   of these features have worked 100% of the time, which is previously unheard of .\\n45                                                                                                                              Removing a  feature  from the Programs and Features panel simply disables access to it, but the underlying program files associated with that feature remain on the hard, drive taking up space .\\n46                                                                                                                                                          I also noticed improved power management, including once of my favorite features which is the auto dimming of my laptop monitors once my computer is not being used .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   All the features of Vista, but without any of the problems .\\n48                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            It still works pretty good though, just a lack of some features that i had before .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                                                                            What I will highlight are a few features of Windows 7 which I have been thoroughly impressed with .\\n50                                                                                                                      Perhaps my expectations were low, since Microsoft OSes tend usually to be just functional   without much pizazz or many  power user  shortcuts and features, but Windows 7 really is a well, crafted OS .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                                                                I do not use most of the features, such as gaming, that seem to benefit most from the upgrade .\\n52                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Does the new operating system have cool features ?\\n53                                                                                                                              My only complaint would be that I would like to have a family pack available in the Windows Professional flavor or at least the option to purchase some of the professional features separately .\\n54                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Seems like they actually stepped it down when it should have been stepped up with more features .\\n55                                                                                                                                                                I think the reason it didn't is because it wants to force the user to use the Windows Live toolbar that includes other features similar to what Google offers .\\n56                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Smooth OS with great little features .\\n57                                                                                                                                                                                         A lot of the new finder desktop windows features are awkward working versions of what Mac OS X has had for a couple of years or more .\\n58                                                                                                    If you didn't come over from the bright side you would probably think these features are very cool, so enjoy them for what they are if you've never played around with a Mac enough to be comfortable in that environment .\\n59

already .\\n60

plently of less expensive places to eat .\\n2

shared since we are not big eaters .\\n3

immediately avialable .\\n5                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The Lobby bar does not serve food very late at night and we couldn't find any vending machines for soda or snacks, so stop at a nearby market before going in for the night .\\n6

for 4 days 3 nights .\\n7                                                                                                                                                                  But the presentation was awesome and the food was so good and not having to walk in the dark at night and scare my mother or pay for a taxi or bus, but sit around and eat comfortably in my pajamas was well worth the cost to me .\\n8

Bockwinkels is a well stocked mini grocery 2 blocks south and 1 block east on street level for snacks, drinks and all kinds of deli prepared foods, plus the Aon Center's underground food court 2 blocks south and 2 .\\n10

minutes walk away .\\n11

the $40 pp .\\n12                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 So if you move around bottles in the fridge so that you can store your own food personal items, the sensor will send a signal to the hotel and you will be charged .\\n13

.\\n14

                                                Room service food quality was very good but with a $7 tray charge plus 20% service, I then absolutely refuse to tip for delivery .\\n17

there is a market one block south of the Hyatt that has wine beer and food for reasonable prices until 2am, and a Dominick's   grocery store across the river open til 1am .\\n18

.\\n10                                                                                                                                                                                                The light weight, the battery life, the keyboard, the non, protruding removable battery, the bright screen, the track pad disable button and general ease of use makes it hard to beat .\\n11

 I recommend minimizing the size of the scroll zones on the right and bottom, other wise you find the screen suddenly scrolling when you did not want it to do so .\\n12

out of a screen  , but on occasion it will zoom when you don't want or expect it to because of an inadvertent gesture or touch by a thumb, etc .\\n13                                                                                                                                                                                                        The occasional blue screen of death unfortunately has not gone away  Microsoft attributes it to an errant driver, but I have not been able to isolate what driver is the cause .\\n14

          There are 2 bios updates and the latest is for a brighter screen setting .\\n16

in the screen would be nice a new model not yet available in the U .\\n27

                         The touchpad works well, the screen glossy, ness really doesn't bother me, and it's not too bad of a fingerprint magnet .\\n33

not full screen for some reason, but switching to full screen display has taken care of that issue for me .\\n35

with a two, fingered gesture on the scratchpad, you can enlarge or shrink the screen .\\n36              It won't give you all the functionality of a full, sized laptop, and the small screen may take some getting used to, but no regular laptop gives you this kind of battery life, and most of the functions absent here aren't used by most people most of the time anyway, so if the tradeoff is fewer features for greatly, increased battery life, I'll take the latter .\\n37

come across is how for some, the screen doesn't tilt back far enough .\\n47

want the screen to tilt far enough back to lay flat .\\n48                                                            And if you can't wait to twist yourself into some contortion in bed where you need the screen to go back further than reasonable, you can always invest in one of those $20 lap desks ,  you know, the kind with the beanbag bottom, so that you can shift the desk into whatever ridiculous position will suit your fancy .\\n49

features  impressed me .\\n50

                                                 I was also nervous about the fact that occasionally the image on the computer screen  shivered , although it normally recovered from that .\\n52



                                                      The screen is too small for any meaningful work, but the apps DO work .\\n55

Again, the screen is too small for this to be anything more than just satisfying from a purchase standpoint .\\n56

                     The screen is small, only 1024 x 600 .\\n59

                                     The most noticeable difference is the screen and keyboard functionality .\\n87

easily, more if I turn off WIFI and turn down the screen brightness .\\n89   One of the downside I have noticed is that the netbook is heavy near the hinge because that's where the battery is located and if you want to put it on your lap while sitting, you have to put your hand on the bottom chassis so that the netbook doesn't tip over, and the screen doesn't bend all the way backwards which can be annoy, otherwise this is a really nice netbook .\\n90

sized, , use fullscreen browsing .\\n91

too cramped .\\n92                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                The screen size works just fine for me .\\n93                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Having the touchpad feature of expanding zooming the presentation on the screen is a nice feature, but I have to admit having never needing to use it   .\\n94                                                                                                                                                                                                               And it goes in that bag wrapped in the white paper plastic bag it was originally boxed up in, with another piece of packing plastic between the keyboard and the screen .\\n95

                                                                                                                                                                                                           I love the capability of making the screen bigger or smaller with the mouse pad .\\n129                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The mouse pad is very sensitive so I sometimes find myself on a different part of the screen if I accidentally touch something .\\n130                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The screen is comfortable and sufficently bright for occassional use .\\n131

and the unit runs great .\\n132                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              The greatest shortcoming is the small screen resolution .\\n133                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Yes, screen is small, video card is weak, and keyboard is cramped, but this is the case for other netbooks at this price point .\\n134                                                                                                                                                                                      I have not done an actual test of the full battery life but from what iv seen in general use it has around 9 hours while running wifi and other applications with around half screen brightness .\\n135                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Streaming videos from Hulu and Netflix look incredible on this 10 inch screen .\\n136                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The only minor issue that I have with 1005HA is that it does not allow the screen to rotate further .\\n137                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The screen rotation angle is good enough for putting the netbook on desktop .\\n138                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Due to the size of netbooks and a wide screen format, the screen should have been designed to be able to rotate all the way back to inline with the keyboard .\\n139

The screen is very bright and sharp with a maximum resolution of 1024x600 .\\n140

keyboard is only slightly smaller than a regular one .\\n141                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Performance is good, screen very good, wireless very good, numerous USB ports, and keyboard layout is excellent .\\n142                                                                                                                                             It boots up quickly, especially after getting rid of the extra asus software that auto, boots at startup, its battery life is phenomenal, the screen is clear and easy to read, the keyboard is comfortable to type on and feels natural .\\n143                                                                                                                                               But even with that, and the glossy screen, fingerprint magnet, limited screen tilt, tinny speakers, and intermittent odd glitches, I still think it's a great value and would buy it again today if I were on the market for a netbook .\\n144



using Fair Use Wizard and load them on to memory slot card and they play great, 700mb files look fine on this size of screen .\\n148

    The screen resolution can be a little small at times, but that is a sacrifice I was willing to make .\\n149

use to a smaller screen, the key board actually works better than my laptop though  .\\n150

done  the screen is glossy   .\\n153

.\\n155                                                                                                                                                   As soon as you connect the VGA cable to an unknown projector and press the function key for projection, it automatically adjusts the size and resolution to fit the projector even if it cannot display properly on its own screen .\\n156

                 I personally haven't had a problem with the screen, but it would be fairly unusable outdoors in the sun .\\n159

extra amount, I was looking for the larger screen, the longer battery life and the keyboard ergonomics .\\n160

productivity  flow  on a conventional laptop with a full sized screen and keyboard .\\n161                                                                                                                             This machine is plenty fast, it's just that if I try to do work with it ,  my office's order entry system as displayed on the netbook screen must be scrolled up and down since it's a  chopped  1024 x 600 height screen, instead of the more usual 786 .\\n162                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  you lose those 186 pixels and even one line of a large order maintenance screen can require you to have to break the flow of productivity to scroll .\\n163

probably the biggest drawback .\\n164                                                                                                                                                                                                             Could be better and don't use the highest resolution unless you want all of your stuff to have the wrong aspect ration on the screen It flattens it to make more visible .\\n165

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            That extra space the menu and address bar take up are sorely needed on this small screen .\\n167

                                                                                                                                                Because the screen is so small in order to get the standard 1024x 768 display without having to scroll the normal screen the screen has to be  smashed  so the display is slightly altered .\\n169

setting that lets you  compress  the screen which makes everything smaller and allows you to fit more on the screen .\\n170

it's because of the smallness of the screen, , I just can't see what I'm doing as well as a laptop .\\n171

                 As others have noted, I wish the screen wasn't so reflective .\\n172

fix, but I don't like the aspect ratio of the screen either .\\n173

my bigger laptop except a large screen .\\n174
