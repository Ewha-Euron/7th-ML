minutes of driving .\\n5     The transmission is horrible, it shifts revs horribly at the wrong times, it putters when it hits 1 1 2 rpms while coasting unless you rev it or hit the breaks, if you try to start the car in really cold weather it makes a horrible grinding noise, the dash rattles ALL the time, when I try to accelerate getting on the freeway it doesnt move & scares me and when it does move it revs even after take your foot from the gas .\\n6

more than give directions and order full price tickets to events then don't stay here .\\n32                                                                                                                                              However the hotel is very large and loses some personal service as a result ,  the service we received was variable, with little recognition of our Platinum Priority Club Rewards status, and slow room service   .\\n33

                                                           Talking about food, something worth noticing is that there was a fridge in the room, but it was completely reserved for the mini, bar service beverages, which completely filled it .\\n38

           30am, service finished at 11am, there was a queue for the toasters and the cooked breakfast was uninspiring ,  the ingredients seemed poor quality .\\n40                                                                                                                                                                                      Room service is expensive but good, the food was

                                               There is also a laundry service at the hotel, but they also change an outrageous amount so unless you have an expense account I wouldn't plan on using it

minutes .\\n63

  on the 14th floor without having to ask, despite booking on Priceline .\\n71

at best as a Motel 6 quality .\\n72                                                                                                                                                                                                  Service at reception both for checking in or out can be slow and although I've always found the staff to be pleasant, not all of them fully understand english .\\n73                                   The buffet breakfast is ok although not the best I've had and usually includes a selection of fresh fruit as well as the usual 'full english' The food in the ground floor restaurant is good  I haven't had problems with room service although the menu has recently changed and doesn't have as good a selection as it did .\\n74

minutes of driving .\\n5     The transmission is horrible, it shifts revs horribly at the wrong times, it putters when it hits 1 1 2 rpms while coasting unless you rev it or hit the breaks, if you try to start the car in really cold weather it makes a horrible grinding noise, the dash rattles ALL the time, when I try to accelerate getting on the freeway it doesnt move & scares me and when it does move it revs even after take your foot from the gas .\\n6

more than give directions and order full price tickets to events then don't stay here .\\n32                                                                                                                                              However the hotel is very large and loses some personal service as a result ,  the service we received was variable, with little recognition of our Platinum Priority Club Rewards status, and slow room service   .\\n33

                                                           Talking about food, something worth noticing is that there was a fridge in the room, but it was completely reserved for the mini, bar service beverages, which completely filled it .\\n38

           30am, service finished at 11am, there was a queue for the toasters and the cooked breakfast was uninspiring ,  the ingredients seemed poor quality .\\n40                                                                                                                                                                                      Room service is expensive but good, the food was

                                               There is also a laundry service at the hotel, but they also change an outrageous amount so unless you have an expense account I wouldn't plan on using it

minutes .\\n63

  on the 14th floor without having to ask, despite booking on Priceline .\\n71

at best as a Motel 6 quality .\\n72                                                                                                                                                                                                  Service at reception both for checking in or out can be slow and although I've always found the staff to be pleasant, not all of them fully understand english .\\n73                                   The buffet breakfast is ok although not the best I've had and usually includes a selection of fresh fruit as well as the usual 'full english' The food in the ground floor restaurant is good  I haven't had problems with room service although the menu has recently changed and doesn't have as good a selection as it did .\\n74

more features than the MacBook, and which cost way less than the MacBook, too .\\n4

.\\n5                                                                                                                                               If you're used to OS X, but want to come into the PC world where things cost less and you get more features, by all means consider Windows 7 the stepping stone to do just that .\\n6                                                                                                                                  After seeing the pricing on the newest MacBooks this week, and the limited features compared to what I currently own, I have to say that now is the right time to consider that switch to PC .\\n7

                                                                                                     Also there are some other new things such as touch gesture features and disk encryption that normal users won't use either because it isn't needed or the hardware isn't widely adopted yet   .\\n9

                                                         But what I really like about Windows 7 are the new and improved features it offers .\\n11

           , then Vista, but if so, none of its features have been impressive enough to have blown me away .\\n14

                                                Having used Windows ME and XP for several years, and before upgrading, Vista, I heard a lot of great things about Windows 7, as well as new features

  Windows 7 Ultimate is there too off course, but I personally can't bring myself to spend that much more money just to get a tiny few features that I know I will never use like multi, language support and BitLocker .\\n23

don't find useful, BUT if in the future I do need them, they're there .\\n25

                           Vista has more features than XP, but many of them didn't make the OS more usable for me .\\n27   Personally I thought Vista was very handsome, what with its transparency, 3, D effects, color schemes, and usability improvements to Windows Explorer, and I believe Windows 7 continues that trend by looking just as sexy , ,  if not more , ,  while at the same time adding its own valuable features and enhancements .\\n28                                                                                                                                                                                                             I haven't yet become accustomed to some features like Aero Shake, but hey, those things are there if I need them .\\n29                                                                     I can't tell what positives it offers still, but it's still a nifty upgrade with a lot of nifty features over XP that make for a more fun experience for some, and a more organized experience involving navigating huge catacombs of archives and files .\\n30

features ?\\n31

files associated with that feature remain on the hard, drive taking up space .\\n46                                                                                                                                                          I also noticed improved power management, including once of my favorite features which is the auto dimming of my laptop monitors once my computer is not being used

pizazz or many  power user  shortcuts and features, but Windows 7 really is a well, crafted OS .\\n51

from the upgrade .\\n52

option to purchase some of the professional features separately .\\n54

to force the user to use the Windows Live toolbar that includes other features similar to what Google offers .\\n56

                           A lot of the new finder desktop windows features are awkward working versions of what Mac OS X has had for a couple of years or more .\\n58                                                                                                    If you didn't come over from the bright side you would probably think these features are very cool, so enjoy them for what they are if you've never played around with a Mac enough to be comfortable in that environment .\\n59

turned on .\\n6                                                                                                                                                                                             Some of the Asus special on screen controls, update and expand features built into the machine have not been all that useful and some border on being advertisements for buying Asus stuff .\\n7                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Two other things that make this a superior computer are battery life, and the LED backlighting for the screen .\\n8                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The ways the screen opens   enables a smaller footprint when the case is closed, although it limits how far back the screen will tilt .\\n9                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Surfing the net is a breeze, but I did have one  blue screen of death  when dealing with one demanding internet site .\\n10                                                                                                                                                                                                The light weight, the battery life, the keyboard, the non, protruding removable battery, the bright screen, the track pad disable button and general ease of use makes it hard to beat .\\n11                                                                                                                                                                                                                      I recommend minimizing the size of the scroll zones on the right and bottom, other wise you find the screen suddenly scrolling when you did not want it to do so .\\n12

expect it to because of an inadvertent gesture or touch by a thumb, etc .\\n13

have not been able to isolate what driver is the cause .\\n14

.\\n17

better battery life, bigger drive, more upgradeable, etc .\\n24

glossy, ness really doesn't bother me, and it's not too bad of a fingerprint magnet .\\n33                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        On full screen display is smooth and no issues .\\n34                                                                                                                                                                                                       Some iTunes content is a little laggy if it is maximized display, but not full screen for some reason, but switching to full screen display has taken care of that issue for me .\\n35                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              And with a two, fingered gesture on the scratchpad, you can enlarge or shrink the screen .\\n36              It won't give you all the functionality of a full, sized laptop, and the small screen may take some getting used to, but no regular laptop gives you this kind of battery life, and most of the functions absent here aren't used by most people most of the time anyway, so if the tradeoff is fewer features for greatly, increased battery life, I'll take the latter .\\n37



                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Once I configured Firefox to always run full screen mode  , surfing was no problem with plenty of screen real estate .\\n41

excellently for me so far especially appreciate the touchpad lock button  as well as the screen off function key .\\n42

rearward weight bias so much that it wants to fall backwards  with the screen pushed back all the way\\n43

STUNNING, and if you've got a bright light shining down on it, you've got a choice :\\n44

either move the screen to eliminate the glare, or move the lamp .\\n45                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    I'd far rather have this beautifully crisp screen and make the occasional adjustment for glare, than deal with a matte screen 24 7 .\\n46

doesn't tilt back far enough .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              yeah, you'd probably want the screen to tilt far enough back to lay flat .\\n48                                                            And if you can't wait to twist yourself into some contortion in bed where you need the screen to go back further than reasonable, you can always invest in one of those $20 lap desks ,  you know, the kind with the beanbag bottom, so that you can shift the desk into whatever ridiculous position will suit your fancy .\\n49

                                                                                                                                                                                 Except for difficulties seeing the entire New York Times crossword puzzle all at once on the screen, the Asus satisfies my needs and seems about as fast as my 5, year, old IBM laptop .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             I was also nervous about the fact that occasionally the image on the computer screen  shivered , although it normally recovered from that .\\n52

     The screen is too small for any meaningful work, but the apps DO work .\\n55

anything more than just satisfying from a purchase standpoint .\\n56

of a problem in some lighting conditions .\\n57

screen brightness .\\n89   One of the downside I have noticed is that the netbook is heavy near the hinge because that's where the battery is located and if you want to put it on your lap while sitting, you have to put your hand on the bottom chassis so that the netbook doesn't tip over, and the screen doesn't bend all the way backwards which can be annoy, otherwise this is a really nice netbook .\\n90

                                                 I also needed Web connectivity for research, a screen with a low squint factor and a keyboard that wasn't too cramped .\\n92

feature of expanding zooming the presentation on the screen is a nice feature, but I have to admit having never needing to use it   .\\n94

chopped  1024 x 600 height screen, instead of the more usual 786 .\\n162

to break the flow of productivity to scroll .\\n163

more visible .\\n165

standard 1024x 768 display without having to scroll the normal screen the screen has to be  smashed  so the display is slightly altered .\\n169

it's because of the smallness of the screen, , I just can't see what I'm doing as well as a laptop .\\n171

coffee breakfast restaurant across the street from the tube stop on Gloucester Road that served a good English breakfast at a decent price .\\n51

                                Would definitely recommend this hotel if only for the fair price I got on priceline combined with the great, convenient location, which made it easy to get to all the

get the worst rooms because the price was so good but got a great room on the 16th floor facing the London Eye .\\n53

                                  However, the first price that they charged me was too much so I had to get a refund then be charged the correct amount for a standard room .\\n56

booking until you actually processed the booking and paid for the room ,  this is apparently now normal for many London hotels which I'd never experienced before ,  we ended up paying \\u00a317 more

was an empty fridge which came quite handy for our own beverages, I doubt they would have milk in their minibar  ,  Tea and coffee making facilites and iron with board were a great bonus to what we had expected from our room .\\n91

however, when it came to the continental breakfast, the hotel would not permit us to partake of same, telling us that because we reserved through Hotwire, we were ineligible for the breakfast .\\n95

                                                             Upon our arrival, there was a SLIGHT odor in bathroom but nothing worth complaining about .\\n43                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The bathroom was adequate with thick, fluffy towels .\\n44

                                                      The bathroom was very clean and well appointed with nice towels and toiletries, it was not big, but room enough to do what one needs to .\\n46                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The Tuscan Inn room was quite nicely appointed, the bed was comfortable the chairs   TV adequate, the bathroom reasonably good .\\n47

improvise, which was kind of surprising since the bathrooms were all redone on 2005 .\\n48                                                                                                                     The clever use of mirrors behind the bed helped to create the illusion of space, however, in reality the room was cramped and with two of us trying to use the hand basin and bathroom at the same time was particularly awkward .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The bathroom containing the toilet and the shower was also very small, not to mention the sink and counter directly outside of it .\\n50   Turning the bathroom light on also turns the counter light on, meaning a middle, of, the, night trip to the bathroom means the whole side of the room gets illuminated  and the wooden shutters that were installed in place of traditional curtains to add to the hotel's theme do absolutely nothing to keep the room dark once the sun comes up .\\n51

               The room was a good size but the bathroomm was very small .\\n52

there was a hairdryer .\\n53                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     The wash basin was in the room without any privacy and there was a small bathroom for the toilet and bath shower .\\n54                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The bathroom had not been remodeled in alignment, but it was all very clean and perfectly acceptable .\\n55

                           The bathroom had several problems .\\n56

very nice .\\n57

                                                                                                                                                                                   Then they gave us a room which had a view of a wall, a tiny bathroom so small in fact that the sink had to be in the bedroom .\\n59

it was fine .\\n29

more than give directions and order full price tickets to events then don't stay here .\\n32                                                                                                                                              However the hotel is very large and loses some personal service as a result ,  the service we received was variable, with little recognition of our Platinum Priority Club Rewards status, and slow room service   .\\n33

                                                           Talking about food, something worth noticing is that there was a fridge in the room, but it was completely reserved for the mini, bar service beverages, which completely filled it .\\n38

           30am, service finished at 11am, there was a queue for the toasters and the cooked breakfast was uninspiring ,  the ingredients seemed poor quality .\\n40                                                                                                                                                                                      Room service is expensive but good, the food was

                                               There is also a laundry service at the hotel, but they also change an outrageous amount so unless you have an expense account I wouldn't plan on using it

                                                                                                                                                                                           But there are

minutes .\\n63

problem because of the lifts, and we had a great view of the city from the room .\\n66

for you to leave comments and review your service went missing from my room on the fourth day which speaks volumes .\\n70

  on the 14th floor without having to ask, despite booking on Priceline .\\n71

at best as a Motel 6 quality .\\n72                                                                                                                                                                                                  Service at reception both for checking in or out can be slow and although I've always found the staff to be pleasant, not all of them fully understand english .\\n73                                   The buffet breakfast is ok although not the best I've had and usually includes a selection of fresh fruit as well as the usual 'full english' The food in the ground floor restaurant is good  I haven't had problems with room service although the menu has recently changed and doesn't have as good a selection as it did .\\n74

                                             On the first night of my stay, I tried to use room service .\\n75

that I had ordered .\\n77                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           the atmosphere is such that they are always right and that a customer is doing them a service by staying at the hotel .\\n78

previously owned a 98 Avalon, and found the seats more comfortable than the Honda .\\n8

my daughter's Civic and the dealer service is fantastic, but even good service can't help the uncomfortable seats .\\n10

after 20 minutes of driving !\\n11

                                          I can also fit three car seats in the back which was the reason I was able to go back the the Honda family .\\n19

             Engine performance lacks punch after 60, head rest are poor design, lacks driver seat memory rear seat a c, radio system is marginal compared to Bose, Seats are hard and small for a large

                                          The seat cover was coming out in between the seats .\\n29                                                                                                                              The only for sure complaint I have is the seats seems to hurt my back after I drove for a period of time, this may be because I am use to my silverado truck with leather bucket seats .\\n30                 DON'T rely on your test drive, the seats are Very uncomfortable and when the engine goes into the  econo  mode the vehicle  shifts rocks violently  forward and when leaving the  econo  mode it shifts rocks forward once again which means that the vehicle is  CONTINUOUSLY  SHAKING AND ROCKING .\\n31

very comfortable and ride is very smooth !\\n32

uncomfortable after anything more than 15 minutes of driving due to what I see as a design flaw, the seat curvature is too great, and even with the lumbar support all the way retracted, it still feels like there is some type of bar sticking out in the wrong part of my back   .\\n34                                                                                                                However, long, distance comfort  is poor due to hard, narrow and deeply, bucketed seats combined with a very taut suspension which transmits even minor road imperfections through the whole vehicle

good road manner, and overall it is a good car .\\n25                                                                                                                          I'd highly recommend

                                       You can not get that comfort with any other automaker other than perhaps Honda .\\n27

suspension or it's smooth and comfortable on the road .\\n31                                                                                                                                 The interior is very luxurious and comfortable, however the car feels slower than my 2002 Camry LE .\\n32                                                                                                                                                                    For the comfort and entertainment of the ride, I like the Camry .\\n33

                                                           I have had no transmission issues or rattling, the comfort and ride of this vehicle felt to me much more high end then what I had paid .\\n35                                                                                                                                                                    I love the look, and the comfort, but would never buy one again .\\n36    I've read other reviews stating that the leather seats were not comfortable for long drives due to lack of cushion support, but that's not been the case for me especially after recently driving from Houston to Key West, Fla .\\n37

                                       The car comfort, looks, performance and fuel economy are great but the paint is a disaster .\\n39

                                                                I was not sure at first about trading my 01 Honda Accord but have been more than satisfied with the performance, looks, and comfort .\\n41                                                                                                                                       A little stiffer ride than the xl and xle models I have had, but still comfortable and quiet .\\n42                                                                                                                                                                                                  Very comfortable ride and seating .\\n43                                                                                                                                                                 Very low interior noise level, which adds to the long trip comfort .\\n44                                                                                                The ride, comfort, and drive is as expected, however, the quality and reputation of yore are completely gone for the flagship Camry .\\n45                                                                                       Over the month it was in the shop, we rented several different cars and nothing seemed to measure up to the comfort and options of the Camry .\\n46                                                                                                     The seat comfort is not as it was and I found that the gas, brake pedals are offset too much to the left of my body centerline .\\n47

   Seats are padded more firmly than previous model but comfortable on trips .\\n49                                                                                                                                                           Feels expensive, yet comfortable with larger interior than my Grand Prix .\\n50

the 2007 Camry to be the most uncomfortable cockpit I have every been in .\\n90                                                                                                The headrest presses into

                                                The new looks are what attracted it to me initially, but its relatively smooth drive, comfort and reliability sold me on it .\\n93

road .\\n94                             The ride is very comfortable, although I'm 6'6  and I didn't think head room was an issue but I do think leg room could be better, I think this is mainly because the back seats have tons of leg room .\\n95

            Bottom line was that I was going to be in that driver's seat for years to come and I was not going to skimp on the critical comfort factor .\\n104

                 The interior is upgraded markedly, and although there is a bit less headroom, the added telescoping feature of the steering wheel combined with the greater travel of the seat   yields greater comfort .\\n106                                                                                                                                                   , a luxurious comfort feature,

great gas mileage, I mostly drive city and I am currently receiving 25 .\\n43                                                                                                                                                                                       I just love the VCM makes the car give great mileage .\\n44

cylinders, as needed, to improve mileage .\\n47

driving .\\n51                                                                                                                             I had tons of room in my 4Runner, but I needed something that would get better gas mileage w o giving up power .\\n52                                                                                                                                                                                             I am so very disappointed with the gas mileage !\\n53

                                                                                                                              It feels safe, performs well, looks fantastic and gets decent gas mileage for its size .\\n56                                                                                                                                                                   The Accord is better than other those car on gas mileage and reliability .\\n57                                                                                                                                                                   Strangely, the gas mileage is not as good as the Acura but is acceptable .\\n58

                                                                                                                    Gas mileage is horrible too, 20 mpg city highway after 6000 miles .\\n60                                                                                                                                       If you are looking for a car that is affordable and well built this is the car for you bad gas mileage\\n61                                                                                                                                        In reality we have been very disappointed our in city mileage is 16, 17 and highway is better at 27 .\\n62                                                                                                                         While the mileage is not bad it good be better, but as the acceleration is good for a 4 cylinder it's a trade, off .\\n63                                                                                                                                      I am sure as gas prices go up cars will be built to get better mileage at the expense of acceleration .\\n64                                                                                                                                     Good looking inside and out, comfortable and roomy, commendable performance, and excellent gas mileage .\\n65                                                                                                                                       I live in Chicago and drive downtown and back 2 times a week for school and am getting great mileage .\\n66                                                                                                                                                        Only update is after about 5k miles the fuel mileage is less than I had anticipated .\\n67                                                                                                               Everything else such gas mileage, handling, stereo system is fine but it doesn't make up for the loud rattles and wind noise .\\n68                                                                                                                         It's almost embarrassing driving such a nice car around a parking lot and have it sound like a high mileage beater .\\n69                                                                                                                             So I saved $2 K upfront and will also save down the road since the 4 cylinder gets slightly better gas mileage .\\n70                                                                                                                                                                         It is a well built car that runs smooth and gets great gas mileage .\\n71                                                                                                                                                                                                 Gas mileage is still getting better though .\\n72                                                                                                                                                                           The gas mileage on the highway is about the same for both models .\\n73                                                                                                                                        Local mileage with the '08 has been about 24 mpg, and about 25 mpg with the '06's that we've leased .\\n74                                                                                                                                                              I decided to go back to Honda as even with high mileage they keep their value .\\n75                                                                                                                          Mileage ,  also not impressive ,  all I can get is about 24mpg, far from the 32 mpg you see on the window sticker .\\n76                                                                                                                                                                           Posted mileage ratings are for those who have a heavy right foot .\\n77                                                                                                                                                            Gas mileage is fantastic especially going from a V8 SUV to a 4 cylinder sedan   .\\n78            I was tempted to go for the V6, but I drive 42 miles one way to work and we have an '07 Odyssey with the variable cylinder management system and unless you're on long highway runs it doesn't get the gas mileage Honda claims .\\n79                                                                       I just love this car ,  and with almost double the highway gas mileage that I was getting with my Grand Cherokee ,  that adds a lot of $$ towards my monthly payment .\\n80                                                                                                                                                                                                            190 hp and superior gas mileage .\\n81                                                                                                                                                                 It wasn't worth saving the little difference in gas mileage for this Honda .\\n82                                                                                                                   The gas mileage is about 45 to the gallon going on the highway with cruise at about 800 or 900 RPM and about 38 going 70 .\\n83                                                                                                                                                  The Gas mileage is good, the acceleration sometime is slow when cold from 1st to 2nd gear .\\n84                                                                                                                                                                                     I hope to get better mileage on extended highway trips .\\n85                                                                                                          I think the mileage would be even better with a 6,

getting 5 mpg less then 06 Accord .\\n132

                                             I'd highly recommend the Tuscan Inn based on location, cheerfulness of staff, aesthetics in the room and general overall service .\\n34

not have been more helpful and whilst we did not avail his services, the concierge always seemed to be busy with guests giving info and advice .\\n36

                                        The highlight of this hotel for us was the service offered by the staff, particularly the two concierges on duty while we were there .\\n41

could rest, and when we finally stepped out for about an hour, we changed the sign for maid service and everything was perfect when we returned !\\n43

            Valet parking for $40 per night seems a bit steep,but at least the service was efficient and quick .\\n52

is conveniently located to the shopping centre across the road, and we made use of this to purchase our breakfast requirements, as we had not had great service from the adjoining cafe Pescatore for our evening meal and thought we would do our own thing each morning .\\n75

massive queue for the restaurant, the food was beginning to run low we went down at 9 .\\n21

but good, the food was delivered hot and was tasty but was chosen from the current uninspired Holiday Inn room service menu, when I ordered a \\u00a36 .\\n23

buy food from Sainsburys or Waitrose which were 2 minutes away to save money .\\n24

                                Shame that we had to use the forum restaurant this morning prior to check out ,  this restaurant is on the first floor and is one of the buffet style breakfasts so

recommendeating out as the evening food is frozen re, heat type and for the price you are paying it is not simply worth it .\\n43

day the food served wasnt changed .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                                        We ate in the bistro downstairs and the food was very good ,  although the portions varied significantly depending on the chef that night .\\n48    The buffet breakfast is ok although not the best I've had and usually includes a selection of fresh fruit as well as the usual 'full english' The food in the ground floor restaurant is good  I haven't had problems with room service although the menu has recently changed and doesn't have as good a selection as it did .\\n49

                                             Food is overpriced everywhere due to $ to pound conversion of course .\\n68

scotch were very reasonably priced always !\\n69

                                                                                                                                                                                   Another good thing is

fraction of the cost .\\n72

gets double the gas mileage and so far, no problems .\\n37                                                                                                                              Aside from missing the turbo's acceleration, I've preferred the Accord's better mileage, handling and comfort .\\n38                                                                                                                                                          The manual transmission lets me control the car better and achieve higher mileage .\\n39                                                                                                                                                  So beware, if you are trading in your V8 for a mileage vehicle, this is not it in my case .\\n40                                                                                                                                                     The car is getting great gas mileage   even though I have only been driving it 2 weeks .\\n41                                                                                                                                                                           Our 2008 Accord is very disappointing, our in town mileage is 14 .\\n42                                                                                                                                                                Gets great gas mileage, I mostly drive city and I am currently receiving 25 .\\n43                                                                                                                                                                                       I just love the VCM makes the car give great mileage .\\n44                                                                                                                                                                                                         Initial gas mileage looks good too .\\n45                                                                                                                                                                                            Don't buy this car if you want good gas mileage .\\n46                                                                                                  I have a V, 6 with Variable Cylinder Management which is supposed to let the car run on 3,4 or 6 cylinders, as needed, to improve mileage .\\n47

                 It is fun to drive, I love the color, it has great features, the sound system is nice, the power is perfect and the gas mileage is great !\\n49                                                                                                                                           Fun to drive, fairly roomy, looks good, gas mileage is OK  , but not as good as Honda advertises .\\n50                                                                                                                                                                     Gas mileage is wonderful, 1st tank 26 mpg with almost all city driving .\\n51                                                                                                                             I had tons of room in my 4Runner, but I needed something that would get better gas mileage w o giving up power .\\n52

                                                                                                               I will warn you though, that if you drive it like it should be driven, gas mileage isn't the best .\\n55                                                                                                                                                     It feels safe, performs well, looks fantastic and gets decent gas mileage for its size .\\n56                                                                                                                                                                   The Accord is better than other those car on gas mileage and reliability .\\n57                                                                                                                                                                   Strangely, the gas mileage is not as good as the Acura but is acceptable .\\n58

after 6000 miles .\\n60                                                                                                                                       If you are looking for a car that is affordable and well built this is the car for you bad gas mileage\\n61                                                                                                                                        In reality we have been very disappointed our in city mileage is 16, 17 and highway is better at 27 .\\n62                                                                                                                         While the mileage is not bad it good be better, but as the acceleration is good for a 4 cylinder it's a trade, off .\\n63                                                                                                                                      I am sure as gas prices go up cars will be built to get better mileage at the expense of acceleration .\\n64                                                                                                                                     Good looking inside and out, comfortable and roomy, commendable performance, and excellent gas mileage .\\n65                                                                                                                                       I live in Chicago and drive downtown and back 2 times a week for school and am getting great mileage .\\n66                                                                                                                                                        Only update is after about 5k miles the fuel mileage is less than I had anticipated .\\n67                                                                                                               Everything else such gas mileage, handling, stereo system is fine but it doesn't make up for the loud rattles and wind noise .\\n68                                                                                                                         It's almost embarrassing driving such a nice car around a parking lot and have it sound like a high mileage beater .\\n69                                                                                                                             So I saved $2 K upfront and will also save down the road since the 4 cylinder gets slightly better gas mileage .\\n70                                                                                                                                                                         It is a well built car that runs smooth and gets great gas mileage .\\n71                                                                                                                                                                                                 Gas mileage is still getting better though .\\n72                                                                                                                                                                           The gas mileage on the highway is about the same for both models .\\n73                                                                                                                                        Local mileage with the '08 has been about 24 mpg, and about 25 mpg with the '06's that we've leased .\\n74                                                                                                                                                              I decided to go back to Honda as even with high mileage they keep their value .\\n75                                                                                                                          Mileage ,  also not impressive ,  all I can get is about 24mpg, far from the 32 mpg you see on the window sticker .\\n76                                                                                                                                                                           Posted mileage ratings are for those who have a heavy right foot .\\n77                                                                                                                                                            Gas mileage is fantastic especially going from a V8 SUV to a 4 cylinder sedan   .\\n78            I was tempted to go for the V6, but I drive 42 miles one way to work and we have an '07 Odyssey with the variable cylinder management system and unless you're on long highway runs it doesn't get the gas mileage Honda claims .\\n79                                                                       I just love this car ,  and with almost double the highway gas mileage that I was getting with my

restaurants including fast food if you like .\\n86                                                                                                                                                              Its location is probably the first thing worth mentioning, being a 10 minutes walk from the natural history museum, a 15 minutes walk from beautiful Hyde Park and just behind the corner of the Gloucester Road underground station   .\\n87

location and overall standards .\\n88

expected, given the location .\\n89

.\\n55    Examples include fit and finish  had to have the drivers door realigned due to metal, to, metal contact causing terrible rattling  , poor fit of interior parts, which causes a lot of rattling, especially when it's cold out  the auto tranny has a history of serious problems and acts weird, and lastly the paint quality, which chips very easily .\\n56
